    "Taking a look at the data immediatly after scraping, there was one problem that immediatly stood out: not all of the speakers could be identified. Almost all of them were, but some were marked with `\"Speaker <number>\"` or `\"Moderator <number>\"`. While this could have been fixed with a careful examination of the original videos alongside the transcrips, that would have been incredibly time-consuming for over 200 rows.\n",

    "Looking at summary statistics for the number of words in dialog by unknown vs. known speakers, we can see that the mean dialog (pun intended) spoken by an unknown speaker is less than one quarter the length of that of a known speaker. It is also much more closely clustered around that smaller size (with a SD of ~15.83 versus the SD of ~47.76 for known speakers). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the relatively small number of unknown lines (~3% of the total), and the small size of those lines, we are simply removing the rows with unknown speakers. After doing so, our next step will be to clean up the names of the remaining speakers."

One, I would need to know how many clusters (i.e. people) I needed to find, and two, I'd need to take the time to implement that rather heavy way of doing things, in which time I could have done the one-time task several times over. With that in mind, I went through the unique list of names by hand and created a table that would tell me what actual names correspond to names in the transcripts. \n",
