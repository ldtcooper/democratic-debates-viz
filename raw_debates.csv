speaker,dialog,debate_num
Lester Holt,  comment on every topic but over the course of the next two hours we will hear from everyone wed also like to ask the audience to keep their reactions to a minimum we are not going to be shy about making sure the candidates stick to time tonight,1
Savannah G., all right so with that business out of the way we want to get to it and well start this evening with senator elizabeth warren senator good evening to you,1
Senator Warren, thank you its good to be here,1
Savannah G., you have many plans free college free childcare government healthcare cancellation of student debt new taxes new regulations the breakup of major corporations but this comes at a time when 71 of americans say the economy is doing well including 60 of democrats what do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy,1
Senator Warren, i think of it this way who is this economy really working for its doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top its doing great for giant drug companies its just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled its doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the african americans and latinx whose families were torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined,1
Senator Warren, its doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us when youve got a government when youve got an autonomy that does great for those with money and isnt doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple we need to call it out we need to attack it head on and we need to make structural change in our government in our economy and in our country,1
Savannah G., senator klobuchar you called programs like free college something you might do if you were quote a magic genie to be blunt are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters and people a false sense of whats actually achievable,1
Amy Klobachar, well first the economy we know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and donald trump just sits in the white house and gloats about whats going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums i do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids i do but i think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education my own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college theres many paths to success as well as certifications,1
Amy Klobachar, secondly id use pell grants id double them from 6000 to 12000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to 100000 then the third thing i would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because i can tell you this if billionaires can pay off their yachts students should be able to pay off their student loans,1
Savannah G., thats time thank you congressman orourke what weve just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable in that vein some democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70 on the very highest earners those making more than 10 million a year would you support that if not what would your top individual rate be,1
Beto O’Rourke, this economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isnt and its going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does  right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes thats how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest a 2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality a new democracy that is revived because weve returned power to the people no packs no gerrymandering automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now,1
Savannah G., congressman orourke,1
Beto O’Rourke, thats how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody,1
Savannah G., congressman thats time sir ill give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question would you support a 70 individual marginal tax rate yes no or pass,1
Beto O’Rourke, i would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone tax capital,1
Savannah G., 70,1
Beto O’Rourke,  at the same rate that you tax ordinary income take that corporate tax rate up to 28,1
Savannah G., okay thats time,1
Beto O’Rourke,  you would generate the revenues you need to pay for the programs were talking about,1
Savannah G., thats time thank you senator booker there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations as you know senator warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like facebook amazon and google youve said we should not be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process why do you disagree,1
Cory Booker, i dont think i disagree i think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor we have people that work fulltime jobs and still cant make a living wage we see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy thats hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete,1
Cory Booker, one of the most aggressive bills in the senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector i feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work ill tell you this i live in a low income black and brown community i see every single day that this economy is not working for average americans the indicators that are being used from gdp to wall streets rankings is not helping people in my community it is about time that we have economy that works for everybody not just the wealthiest in our nation,1
Savannah G., quickly senator booker you did say that you didnt think it was right to name names to name companies and single them out as senator warren has briefly why is that,1
Cory Booker, well again i will single out companies like halliburton or amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that when it comes to antitrust law what i will do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it number two have a doj and a federal trade commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration at the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing we see that with everything from citizens united and the way theyre trying to influence washington its about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country,1
Savannah G., thats time sir,1
Cory Booker, we need to have someone thats a champion for them,1
Savannah G., thank you senator warren i mentioned you are you picking winners and losers,1
Senator Warren, the way i understand this is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country that hurts workers it hurts small businesses it hurts independent farmers it hurts our economy overall and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy now look weve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back whats been missing is courage courage in washington to take on the giants thats part of the corruption in this system,1
Senator Warren, it has been for too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions have been funding the super pacs have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in washington where i want to start this is i want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolies and saying i have the courage to go after them,1
Savannah G., thank you,1
Lester Holt, secretary castro the next question is for you democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades what would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country,1
Julian Castro, thank you very much for that question lester i grew up with a mother who raised my brother joaquin and me as a single parent and i know what its like to struggle i know what its like to rent a home and to worry about whether youre going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because theyre women i would do several things starting with something we shouldve done a long time ago which is to pass the equal rights amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country its past time that we did that and we have to do this if we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve,1
Lester Holt, all right thank you i want to put the same question to congresswoman gabbard your thoughts on equal pay,1
Tulsi Gabbard, well first of all lets recognize the situation were in that the american people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful thats not what we have right now i enlisted in the army national guard after the alqaeda terror attacks on 911 so i could go after those who had attacked us on that day i still serve as a major served over 16 years deployed twice in the middle east and in congress serve on the foreign affairs and armed services committees for over six years,1
Tulsi Gabbard, i know the importance of our national security as well as the terribly high cost of war and for too long our leaders have failed us taking us from one regime change war to the next leading us into a new cold war an arms race costing us trillions of our hard earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives this insanity must end as president i will take your hard earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs things like healthcare a green economy good paying jobs protecting our environment and so much more,1
Jose D.B., mayor de blasio good evening youre the mayor of the biggest city in the united states but its also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor how would you address income inequality,1
Mayor de Blasio, well weve been addressing income inequality in new york city by raising wages by raising benefits by putting money back in the hands of working people 15 minimum wage paid sick days prek for all things that are making a huge difference in working peoples lives but let me tell you what were hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle from the heart and soul of our party i want to make it clear this is supposed to be the party of working people,1
Mayor de Blasio, yes were supposed to be for 70 tax rate on the wealthy yes were supposed to be for free college free public college for our young people we are supposed to break up big corporations when theyre not serving our democracy this democratic party has to be strong and bold and progressive and in new york weve proven that we can do something very different,1
Mayor de Blasio, we can put money back in the hands of working people and let me tell you every time you talk about investing in people in their communities you hear folks say theres not enough money what i say to them every single time is theres plenty of money in this world theres plenty of money in this country its just in the wrong hands we democrats have to fix that,1
Jose D.B., congressman delaney do you agree,1
John Delaney, i think we need to do real things to help american workers and the american people right this is the issue that all of us here on the campaign trail we need to make sure everyone has a living wage and ive called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave that will create a situation where people actually have a living wage that gets right to workers then weve got to fix our public education system its not delivering the results our kids needs nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that,1
John Delaney, im very different than everyone else here on this stage prior to being in congress i was an entrepreneur i started two businesses i created thousands of jobs i spent my whole career helping small to mid size businesses all over the country 5000 of them i supported the obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities i know how to create jobs we need to a short term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave and then we need to have a longterm strategy to make sure this country is competitive and were creating jobs everywhere,1
Jose D.B., thank you,1
John Delaney,  in this country,1
Jose D.B., governor inslee how would you address income inequality,1
Jay Inslee, well im a little bit surprised i think plans are great but im a governor and we got to realize the people who brought us the weekend unions  folks it is not right that the ceo of mcdonalds makes 2100 times more than the people slinging hash at mcdonalds the next thing ill do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future,1
Jay Inslee, look at donald trump is simply wrong he says wind turbines cause cancer we know they cause jobs and we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future carpenters ibws members machinists were doing it in my state today and then we can do what america always does lead the world and invent the future and put people to work thats what were going to do,1
Jose D.B., to congressman ryan president trump and you just referred to him promised that manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of ohio can you make that same promise,1
Tim Ryan, yes i believe you can but the first lets say the president came he said dont sell your house to people in youngstown ohio and in his administration just in the last two years we lost 4000 jobs at a general motors facility that rippled throughout our community general motors got a tax cut general motors got a bail out and then they have the audacity to move a new car that theyre going to produce to mexico,1
Tim Ryan, ive had family members that have the unbolt a machine from the factory floor put it in a box and ship it to china my area where i come from in northeast ohio this issue were talking about here its been going on 40 years this is not a new phenomenon in the united states of america the bottom 60 havent seen a raise since 1980 meanwhile the top 1 controlled 90 of the wealth we need an industrial policy saying were going to dominate building electric vehicles theres going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years i want half of them made in the united states i want to dominate the solar industry,1
Jose D.B., thank you,1
Tim Ryan,  and manufacture those here in the united states,1
Jose D.B., senator warren are they coming back are these jobs coming back,1
Senator Warren, weve had an industrial policy in the united states for decades now and its basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do giant corporations have exactly one loyalty and that is to profits and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico or to asia or to canada theyre going to do it,1
Senator Warren, heres what i propose for an industrial policy start with a place where theres a real need theres going to be a worldwide need for green technology ways to clean up the air ways to clean up the water and we can be the ones to provide that we need to go 10 fold in our research and development on green energy going forward and then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research they can make all kinds of products from it but they have to be manufactured right here in the united states of america and then we have to double down and sell it around the world theres a 23 trillion market coming for green products we should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 12 million manufacturing,1
Lester Holt, thank you,1
Senator Warren,  jobs here in america we can do this,1
Lester Holt, all right were going to turn to the issue of healthcare right now and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan just a show hands start off with all right well senator klobuchar let me put the question to you youre one of the democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government healthcare plan why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul,1
Amy Klobachar, well i think its a bold approach its something that barack obama wanted to do when we were working on the affordable care act and that is a public option i am just simply concerned about kicking half of america off of their health insurance in four years which is exactly what this bill says,1
Amy Klobachar, let me go on beyond that theres a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals the president literally went on tv on fox and said that peoples heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices instead 2500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office instead he gave 100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies for the rest of us for the rest of america thats what we call at home all foam and no beer we got nothing out of it and so my proposal is to do something about pharma to take them on to allow negotiation under medicare to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries and pharma thinks they own washington well they dont own me,1
Lester Holt, your time is up thank you senator warren you signed onto bernie sanders medicare for all plan it would put essentially everybody on medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president,1
Senator Warren, yes im with bernie on medicare for all let me tell you why i spend a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care medical bills thats not just for people who dont have insurance its for people who have insurance look at the business model of an insurance company its to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare,1
Senator Warren, that leaves families with rising premiums rising copays and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need medicare for all solves that problem i understand there are a lot of politicians who say oh its just not possible we just cant do it its  have a lot of political reasons for this what theyre really telling you is they just wont fight for it well healthcare is a basic human right and i will fight for basic human rights ,1
Lester Holt, thank you congressman orourke when you ran for senate you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance this year youre saying youre no longer sure can you explain why,1
Beto O’Rourke, my goal is to ensure that every american is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care in laredo texas i met a young man 27 years old told me that hed been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had diabetes he was told he had glaucoma and he was told untreated because he doesnt have health care hell be dead before the age of 40 getting to guaranteed high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider the ability to see a mental healthcare provider ,1
Beto O’Rourke, in texas the single provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible our plan says if youre uninsured we enroll you in medicare if youre insufficiently insured you cant afford your premiums we enroll you in medicare but if youre a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you,1
Lester Holt, your time is up,1
Beto O’Rourke,  your family  youre able to keep it we preserve choice by making sure,1
Lester Holt, your time is up congressman but i do want to ask a followup on this one just to be very clear ill give you 10 seconds would you replace private insurance,1
Beto O’Rourke, no i think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for ,1
Mayor de Blasio, hey wait wait wait congressman orourke congressman orourke private insurance is not working for tens of millions of americans when you talk about the copays the deductibles the premiums the out of pocket expenses its not working,1
Beto O’Rourke, thats right so for those,1
Mayor de Blasio, how can you defend the system thats not working,1
Beto O’Rourke,  for whom its not working  they can choose medicare right for those not working they can choose medicare,1
Mayor de Blasio, congressman youve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people ,1
Beto O’Rourke, for the  workers in nevada who i listened to who negotiated for those plans theyre able to keep them,1
Mayor de Blasio, why are you defending private insurance ,1
John Delaney,  million americans say they like their private health insurance by the way it should be noted that 100 million americans  i mean i think we should be the party that keeps whats working and fixes whats broken i mean doesnt that make sense i mean we should give everyone in this country healthcare as a basic human right for free full stop but we should also give them the option to buy private insurance why do we have to stand for taking away something from people and also its bad policy if you go to every hospital in this country and you asked them one question which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the medicare rate every single hospital administrator said they would close,1
John Delaney, the medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current medicare rates to some extent were basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed i mean my dad was a union electrician right i actually grew up in a working class family he loved the healthcare that the ibew gave him i just always think about my dad and anything i would do it from a policy perspective hed look at me and hed say good job john for getting healthcare for every american,1
Lester Holt, ive let this,1
John Delaney,  but why are you taking my healthcare away,1
Lester Holt,  play out a little bit because im fascinated to hear the daylight between you congresswoman gabbard,1
Tulsi Gabbard, yes,1
Lester Holt, weigh in here,1
Tulsi Gabbard, i think were talking about this in the wrong way youre talking about one bill over another bill really what were talking about is our objective making sure that every single sick american in this country is able to get the healthcare that they need i believe medicare for all is the way to do that i also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a medicare for all program a program that will reduce the administrative costs reduce the bureaucratic costs and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need i also think if you look at,1
Lester Holt, senator,1
Tulsi Gabbard,  other countries in the world who have universal healthcare every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance i think thats what weve got to look at taking the best of these ideas but making sure unequivocally that no sick american goes without getting the care that they need regardless of how much or little money,1
Lester Holt, congresswoman,1
Tulsi Gabbard,  they have in their pocket,1
Lester Holt, congresswoman thanks let me turn to senator booker on this senator booker explain to me where you are this is hugely important to people so tell us where you are,1
Cory Booker, i absolutely will first of all were talking about this as a healthcare issue but in communities like mine low income communities  an education issue because kids who dont have health care are not going to succeed in school it is an issue for jobs and employment because people that do not have good healthcare do not succeed at work its even a retirement issue because in my community african americans have a lower life expectancy because of poor health care and so where i stand is very clear healthcare is not just a human right it should be an american right,1
Cory Booker, i believe the best way to get there is medicare for all but i have an urgency about this when i am president of the united states im not going to wait we have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care on this debate im sorry there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in america from pharmaceutical companies to insurers literally the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15 while medicares overhead is only at 2 we can do this better and every single day i will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal,1
Lester Holt, your time is up senator,1
Cory Booker,  which is every american having healthcare,1
Lester Holt, your time is up senator i want to move back if i can to ,1
Senator Warren, let me just ask the senator i just want to add to senator bookers point of  and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked 23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system 23 billion and that doesnt count the money that was paid to executives the money that was spent lobbying washington we have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is because its not working for families but its sure as heck working for them,1
Lester Holt, governor inslee,1
Senator Warren, it is time for us to make,1
Lester Holt, governor inslee governor inslee,1
Senator Warren,  families come first,1
Jay Inslee, it should not be an option in the united states of america for any insurance company to deny women coverage for their exercise of their right of choice i am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a womans right of reproductive health and health insurance im the only candidate who has passed a public option i respect everybodys goals and plans here but we do have one candidate thats actually advanced the ball and we got to have access for everyone ive done it as a public option,1
Lester Holt,  your time is up governor senator klobuchar i want to give you,1
Speaker 16, thats a false claim thats a false claim,1
Speaker 17, lester lester,1
Lester Holt, im fascinated by this senator klobuchar,1
Amy Klobachar, i just want to say theres three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a womans right to choose so ill start with that then i just want to make very clear i think we share the goal of universal healthcare the idea i put out there the public option which the governor was just talking about this idea is that you use medicare or medicaid without any insurance companies involved you could do it either way the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums 12 more million people would get covered i think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal healthcare,1
Lester Holt,  secretary castro this one is for you all of you on stage support a womans right to an abortion you all support some version of a government healthcare option would your plan cover abortion mr secretary,1
Julian Castro, yes it would i dont believe only in reproductive freedom i believe in reproductive justice what that means is just because a woman or lets also not forget someone in the trans communitya trans female is poor doesnt mean they shouldnt have the right to exercise that right to choose i absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion,1
Julian Castro, more than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a persons right to choose is under assault in places like missouri in alabama in georgia i would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of roe v wade and would respect it and in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right,1
Lester Holt, senator warren would you put limits on  any limits on abortion,1
Senator Warren, i would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services and that includes birth control it includes abortion it includes everything for a woman i want to add on that its not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us 47 years ago roe versus wade was decided and weve all looked to the courts all that time as state after state has undermined roe has put in exceptions has come right up to the edge of taking away protection,1
Lester Holt, your time is up senator,1
Senator Warren, we now have an america where most people support roe versus wade we need to make that a federal law,1
Lester Holt, senator youre over thank you ,1
Jose D.B., lester thank you senator booker i want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis you represent a state where 14 of the 28 largest pharmaceutical companies are based should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do,1
Cory Booker, they should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible this is one of the reasons why well before i was running for president i said i would not take contributions from pharma companies not take contributions from corporate pacs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long it is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that,1
Jose D.B., congressman orourke how would you deal with it,1
Beto O’Rourke, tonight in this country you have 23 million of our fellow americans behind bars its the largest prison population on the face of the planet many are there for nonviolent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it and yet despite what purdue pharma has done their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that were seeing throughout this country theyve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail unless theres accountability and justice this crisis will continue in my administration we will hold them to account we will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those whove been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and longterm care,1
Lester Holt, i know immigration is on a lot of your minds here and i want to talk about it were going to talk about it in a moment we need to take a break well be back with more from miami after this,1
Jose, we want to turn to an issue that has been in the news especially this week there are undocumented children being held alone in detention even as close as homestead florida right here less than 30 miles from where we are tonight fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the united states of america we saw that image today it broke our hearts and they had names oscar martínez and his 23 month old daughter valeria died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country,1
Jose, last month more than 130000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border secretary castro if you were president today  what would you specifically do,1
Julian Castro, thank you very much jose im very proud that in april i became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan and we saw those images,1
Julian Castro, watching that image of oscar and his daughter valeria is heartbreaking it should also piss us all off if i were president today and it should spur us to action if i were president today i would sign an executive order that would get rid of trumps zero tolerance policy the remain in mexico policy and the metering policy this metering policy is basically what prompted oscar and valeria to make that risky swim across the river they had been playing games with people who were coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry oscar and valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that,1
Jose, on day one sorry im just going to ask you for 30 seconds,1
Julian Castro, on day i would do that executive order that would address metering and then i would follow that up in my first hundred days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims that would put undocumented immigrants as long as they havent committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship and that would go to the root cause of the issue which is we need a marshall plan for honduras and guatemala and el salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the united states to seek it,1
Jose, senator booker what would you do on day one and this is a situation that the next president will inherit,1
Cory Booker, yes ,1
Cory Booker, on day one i will make sure that number one we end the ice policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights when people come to this country they do not leave their human rights at the border number two i will make sure that we reinstate daca that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for daca recipients and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here and then finally we need to make sure that we address the issues that made oscar and valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem we cannot surrender our values and then think that were going to get border security we actually will lose security and our values we must fight for both,1
Julian Castro, if i might very briefly and this is an important point my plan and im glad to see that senator booker senator warren and governor inslee agree with me on this my plan also includes getting rid of section 1325 of the immigration and nationality act to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation to treat that as a civil violation and heres why its important we see all of this horrendous family separation they use that law section 1325 to justify under the law separating little children  from their families,1
Cory Booker, jose,1
Julian Castro, ,1
Jose, 30 seconds senator,1
Cory Booker, as my friend here said i agree with him on that issue but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesnt just go on at our border it happens in our communities as ice are ripping away parents from their american children spouses in the light and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work we must end those policies,1
Bill De Blasio, jose we have to change our discussion about immigration  in this county because look at the bottom line here those tragic that tragic photo of those that parent that child and im saying this as a father every american should feel that in their heart and every american should say that is not america those are not our values but we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system because were not being honest about the division thats been fomented in this country the way that american citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges,1
Bill De Blasio, for all the american citizens out there who feel youre falling behind or feel the american dream is not working for you the immigrants didnt do that to you the big corporations did that to you the 1 did that to you we need to be the party of working people and that includes a party of immigrants but first we have to tell working people in america who are hurting that were going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people were all in this together if we dont change that debate that politics thats holding us back we wont get all these reforms people are talking about ,1
Jose, if i could up sorry  what would you do congressman day one at the white house,1
Beto O’Rourke,  and we would not criminally prosecute any family because who was fleeing violence and persecution we would make sure we implemented,1
Jose, secretary let him finish and i will give you  but let him finish let him finish please yes,1
Beto O’Rourke, we would not detain any family fleeing violence in fact fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today we would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them us citizens here in this country invest in solutions in central america work with regional stakeholders so theres no reason to make  that 2000 mile journey to this country,1
Julian Castro, but we have ,1
Jose, secretary ill give you 30 seconds ,1
Julian Castro, lets be very clear the reason that theyre separating these little children from their families is that theyre using section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them some of us on this stage have called to end that section to terminate it some like congressman orourke have not and i want to challenge all of the candidates to do that,1
Julian Castro, i just think its a mistake beto i think its a mistake and i think that that if you truly want to change the system that we got to repeal that section if not,1
Jose, thank you,1
Julian Castro, then it might  as well stay the same policy,1
Beto O’Rourke, let me respond to this very briefly  actually as a member of congress i helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we dont criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country if youre fleeing,1
Julian Castro, im not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum im talking about everybody else,1
Beto O’Rourke, if youre fleeing desperation then i want to make sure  treated with respect,1
Julian Castro, im still talking about everybody else,1
Beto O’Rourke, but youre looking at just one small part of this im talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws,1
Julian Castro, thats not true,1
Beto O’Rourke, and if you do that  i dont think its asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country,1
Julian Castro, im talking about millions of folks a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum a lot of them are undocumented immigrants right and you said recently that the reason you didnt want to repeal section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking but let me tell you what section 18,1
Jose, secretary,1
Julian Castro, title 18 of the us code title 21 and title 22 already cover human trafficking ,1
Beto O’Rourke, if we apprehend a known smuggler or drug trafficker were going to make sure that they are deported and criminally prosecuted,1
Julian Castro, i think that you should do your homework on this issue if you did your homework on this issue  you would know that we should repeal this section,1
Jose, this is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time and we will for a long time but were going,1
John Delaney, can we talk about the conditions to why people are coming here,1
Jose, lets let lester  savannah sorry savannah i know its just we could go on,1
John Delaney, but rather than talking about specific provisions we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country,1
Savannah, youll get your chance,1
John Delaney, and what were going to do to actually make a difference in these countries,1
Savannah, congressman youll get your chance lets continue the discussion senator klobuchar,1
Amy Klobuchar, yes,1
Savannah, lets talk about what secretary castro just said he wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border do you support that do you think it should be a civil offense only and if so do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here,1
Amy Klobuchar, immigrants they do not diminish america they are america and i am happy to look at his proposal but i do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law,1
Amy Klobuchar, what i really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that 70 of our fortune 500 companies are headed up by people that came from other countries 25 of our us nobel laureates were born in other countries we have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories we need them to start small businesses we need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants,1
Amy Klobuchar, and so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the senate with republican support to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done it brings the debt down by 158 billion,1
Savannah, senator,1
Amy Klobuchar, it gives a path to citizenship for citizen for people who can become citizens  and it wouldnt be so much better for our economy in america,1
Savannah, thats time thank you congressman ryan same question should it be a crime to illegally cross the border or should it be a civil offense only,1
Tim Ryan, well i agree with secretary castro i think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if theyre dealing in drugs and other things thats already established in the law so theres no need to repeat it and i think its abhorrent were talking about this father who got killed with his daughter and the issues here the way these kids are being treated if you go to guantanamo bay there are terrorists that are held that get better healthcare than those kids that have tried to cross the border into the united states that needs to stop,1
Tim Ryan, and i think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids what kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the united states whos focused on hate and fear and division and what has happened now the end result is now weve got kids literally laying in their own snot with three week old diapers that havent been changed weve got to tell this president that is not a sign  of strength mr president that is a sign of weakness,1
Savannah, senator booker  a lot of people jose asked a question if youre president on day one what will you do with the fact that you will have families here theres been a lot of talk about what youll do in the first 100 days about legislation what will you actually do with these families how will you care for them will they be detained or will they not be,1
Cory Booker, well this is a related and brief point because what were talking about what secretary castro and i are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process i have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups,1
Cory Booker, our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether its immigration whether its mental illness whether its addiction we know that this is not the way to deal with problems there is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem donald trump isnt solving this problem weve seen under his leadership a surge at our border we solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity the people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values our ideals as a nation for border security we can have both by doing this the right way,1
Savannah, all right senator thank you let me go to governor inslee on this what would you do on day one same question i just asked cory booker i have yet to hear an answer from anyone  on this stage what will you do with the families that will be here,1
Jay Inslee, there is no reason for the detention and separation of these children they should be released pending their hearings and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed thats what should happen and we should do what were doing in washington state im proud that weve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement for being turned into mini ice agents im proud to have been the first governor to stand up against donald trumps heinous muslim ban im proud to be a person who is not only talked about dreamers but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams these are some of the most inspirational people in our state,1
Jay Inslee, and ill leave you with this thought if you want to know what i think donald trump the other day tried to threaten me he thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees in washington state if we passed a law that i passed and i told him thats not a threat at all we welcome refugees into our state we recognize diversity as a strength this is how we built america that tradition is going to continue if im president of the united states,1
Lester Holt, savannah ,1
John Delaney, just one more topic my grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country,1
Lester Holt, were going to talk about iran right now because were working against the clock tankers have been attacked a us drone has been shot down there have been disturbing threats issued by both the us and iranian leadership id like if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here but what i want to know is how to get dial it back so a show of hands who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated whats the answer well cory senator booker why not,1
Cory Booker, may i address that first and foremost it was a mistake to pull out of that deal and one of the reasons why were seeing this hostility now is because donald trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation literally he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10 20 years and now we see iran threatening to go further and who are pulled being pulled in further and further into this crisis,1
Cory Booker, we need to renegotiate and get back into a deal but im not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally im going to rejoin that deal because when i am president of the united states im going to do the best i can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if i have an opportunity to leverage a better deal im going to do it,1
Lester Holt, all right  you said you would negotiate yourself back into the iranian agreement can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal,1
Julian Castro, yes it was,1
Amy Klobuchar, it was imperfect but it was a good deal for that moment i would have worked to get longer sunset periods and thats something we could negotiate to get back in the deal but the point is donald trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal those were his words and now we are a month away from the iranians who claim now that theyre going to blow the caps on enriching uranium and the iranians have told us this and so thats where we are right now he has made us less safe than we were when he became president,1
Amy Klobuchar, so what i would do is negotiate us back into that agreement is stand with our allies and not give unlimited leverage to china and russia which is what he has done and then finally i would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict and were having this debate in congress right now that he comes to congress for an authorization of military force i would do that and this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war one tweet away from going to war and i dont think we should conduct foreign policy  in our bathrobe at five in the morning,1
Lester Holt, congresswoman gabbard youve said you would sign back onto the 2015 deal would you insist though that it address irans support for hezbollah,1
Tulsi Gabbard, lets deal with the situation where we are where this president and his chicken hawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with iran i served in the war in iraq at the height of the war in 2005 a war that took over 4000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms lives the american people need to understand that this war with iran would be far more devastating far more costly than anything that we ever saw in iraq it would take many more lives it would exacerbate the refugee crisis and it wouldnt be just contained within iran this would turn into a regional war,1
Tulsi Gabbard, this is why its so important that every one of us every single american stand up and say no war with iran we need to get back into the iran nuclear agreement and we need to negotiate how we can improve it it was an imperfect deal there are issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed we can do both simultaneously to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war,1
Lester Holt, your time is up and i have just a very quick follow up but what would your red line be for military action against iran,1
Tulsi Gabbard, obviously if there was an attack against the american our troops then there would have to be a response but my point is and its important for us to recognize this is donald trump and his cabinet mike pompeo john bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with iran which is incredibly dangerous thats why we need to deescalate tensions trump needs to get back into the iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride put the american people first,1
Bill De Blasio, hey but wait a minute neither democrats nor republicans ,1
Savannah, all right but we are out of time were up against a hard break but we will have much more,1
Bill De Blasio, have been serious about the war ,1
Savannah, mayor de blasio well have more  the commercial is coming well continue our questioning next with chuck todd rachel maddow stick around well have a lot more with some very anxious candidates just ahead,1
Speaker 13, all eyes on the 2020 election continue to follow the latest on the candidates with the nbc news mobile app stay connected with breaking news top stories live video and all your favorite nbc news shows text nbcnews to 66866 to get the app now,1
Steve Kornacki, all right well on election day 2020 donald trump will be something he was not on election day 2016 that is president donald trump an incumbent running for reelection in some ways a reelection campaign for a president of course becomes a referendum on how folks feel the president did during his four years in office,1
Steve Kornacki, so what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the trump presidency well what you see here this is his average approval rating meaning youve always got these different polls out there one day nbc will have one the next day cnn will have one theyre always coming in from all over the place this trend line is an average a day to day average of all of those polls put together and what you see here in this trend line is its a very narrow range that trump is operating,1
Steve Kornacki, and what i mean by that is look at this this is his high watermark his peak as president his average approval rating at its best 46 and when was this early february 2017 that was his honeymoon he had just become president that makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60 65 70 at least for a short period they all had honeymoons trumps honeymoon he couldnt even crack 50 so already we see a lower ceiling for trump than weve seen with past presidents,1
Steve Kornacki, but that comes with a flip side and that is the basement for trump look at this 37 is the low point hes hit in his average approval rating is president that is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone weve seen nixon bush senior carter we saw them fall into the 20s at some point during their term that has not happened to trump either 37 in the low end 46 on the high end right now somewhere in between its a very narrow range it speaks to polarization,1
Steve Kornacki, ill tell you it speaks to something else is this presidency really any different politically in terms of how its being received than the campaign in 2016 because compare this trendline 46 37 low high compare that to trumps support against hillary clinton in the polls in the fall of 2016 trumps average support at a low point 36 at a high point about 43 and a half percent of course on election day what was the number he hit 46 the same high water mark hes had in his approval rating so trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate as president we say it speaks to polarization it also speaks to look this is somebody who succeeded as a candidate in 2016 despite some very very high negative numbers,1
Steve Kornacki, what i mean by that is look at this the exit poll on election day do you think donald trumps qualified to be president only 38 said they thought he was qualified for the job the clear majority said trump wasnt qualified does he have the temperament 35 said he had the temperament do you like them do you have a favorable view only 40 did youre not supposed to be able to win with those numbers trump was one of the big reasons his opponent hillary clinton by election day 2016 almost as unpopular as he was only 43 favorable it created that narrow path for trump and that becomes the question when you look at that approval rating now in 2020 can he make his opponent as unpopular on election day as clinton was in 16,1

Speaker 11, all eyes on the 2020 election continue to follow the latest on the candidates with the nbc news mobile app stay connected with breaking news top stories live video and all your favorite nbc news shows text nbcnews to 66866 to get the app now,1
Speaker 12, all right lets take a look at the electoral college and 2020 the place to start obviously is where the last election ended 2016 and remember of course by the popular vote hillary clinton had almost 3 million more of those than donald trump but we dont elect the president by national popular vote we do it by the electoral college and there donald trump had the right combination of votes in the right states enough to win 306 electoral votes for him,1
Speaker 12, so how is that map looking for 2020 well first of all i think one thing you need to do just understand how narrow that trump path was in the electoral college in 2016 you can start by looking at wisconsin look at that margin there fewer than 25000 votes separated clinton from trump in wisconsin this was a state that had not gone for a republican in a presidential election since 1984 by a margin of fewer than 25000 votes trump becomes the first in over three decades he gets wisconsin the margin in michigan even closer barely 10000 votes trump over clinton and again that was the first time since 88 that a republican carried michigan and then there was pennsylvania here about 44000 votes that the margin for trump over clinton in pennsylvania trump wins all three of those states wisconsin michigan pennsylvania by a combined total of about 75000 votes thats it but thats enough to win the electoral college,1
Speaker 12, so for democrats they want to reverse the result of 2016 that is the easiest and most direct path at least on paper you flip those states were trumps margin was the narrowest those states that had been voting democratic before 2016 you flip them back you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same so thats the most direct path for democrats at least on paper but hey things can change over the course of a few years there are other states to be keeping an eye on as well,1
Speaker 12, ill give you an example perfect one right here florida we always talk about florida right remember florida florida florida florida from back in 2000 well heres one again donald trump was somewhat of a surprise on election night i think the clinton campaign had been feeling decent about florida but trump pulled out florida in 2016 29 electoral votes right there we obviously expect to be very competitive in 2020 if the democrats can flip florida just given the size of the state that is a massive change the one cautionary note for democrats though they had a big year in the 2018 midterms it was not big enough to carry over to florida in florida in the 2018 midterms a republican won the governors race republican won the senate race ousted a democratic incumbent in fact in that senate race so florida its tantalizing on paper for democrats its always tantalizing on paper for democrats but does 2018 tell you that maybe theres a little bit more republican strength there in florida,1
Speaker 12, and of course arizona this is one democrats have been talking about now a long time red state the democrats think demographically might be trending in their favor this is a state democrats did do well in in the 2018 midterms winning a senate race there clinton got within three points democrats hope that there is some momentum there some demographic some political momentum and they can flip arizona that could change things too,1
Speaker 13, ive been fighting these companies my whole life,1
Speaker 14, greencoat can cause cancer they hid that so thats where the law comes in,1
Speaker 13, if you fight for whats right you can change the world,1
Chuck Todd, we believe we have the technical difficulties fixed,1
Rachel Maddow, never say that,1
Chuck Todd, never say never but we will march forward here and i will lean forward here a little bit senator warren were going to get to a gun question here parkland florida its just north of here in broward county as you know it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue it has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns including assault weapons ban but even if youre able to implement that what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it,1
Elizabeth W., so in this period of time that ive been running for president ive had more than 100 town halls ive taken more than 2000 unfiltered questions and the single hardest question ive gotten i got one from a little boy and i got one from a little girl and that is to say when youre president how are you going to keep us safe thats our responsibility as adults seven children will die today from gun violence children and teenagers and they wont just die in mass shootings theyll die on sidewalks theyll die in playgrounds theyll die in peoples backyards gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that,1
Elizabeth W., so what can we do we can do the things that are sensible we can do the universal background checks we can ban the weapons of war but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe we need to treat this like the virus thats killing our children,1
Chuck Todd, okay thank you senator warren you didnt address do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there,1
Elizabeth W., so what i think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done you know guns in the hands of a collector whos had them for decades whos never fired who take safety seriously thats very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly we cant treat this as an across the board problem we have to treat it like a public health emergency that means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country whether its politically popular or not,1
Chuck Todd, okay thank you senator senator booker you have a program,1
Elizabeth W., we need to fight for our children,1
Chuck Todd, senator booker you have a federal government buy back program in your plan how is that going to work,1
Cory Booker, well first of all i want to say my colleague and i both have been hearing this on the campaign trail but whats even worse is i hear gunshots in my neighborhood i think im the only i hope im the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week someone i knew shahad smith was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year for millions of americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency and for those who have not been directly effected theyre tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading writing and arithmetic and how to deal with an active shooter in their school,1
Cory Booker, this is something that im tired of and im tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers in my faith people say faith without works is dead so we will find a way but the reason we have a problem right now is weve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate it is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda i will get that done as president of the united states because this is not about policy this is personal,1
Chuck Todd, thank you senator booker,1
Rachel Maddow, secretary castro id like to talk to you about something that senator booker just mentioned there the idea of active shooter drills in schools school shootings seem like an almost every day or every week occurrence now they dont make a complete news cycle anymore no matter the death toll as parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around,1
Julian Castro, yeah rachel im the dad of a 10 year old girl carina whos here tonight and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school a place thats supposed to be safe the answer to your question is no we dont have to accept that and i believe that on january 20 2021 at 1201 pm were going to have a democratic president a democratic house and a democratic senate,1
Julian Castro, and the activists of parkland folks from moms to men who have risen up across the united states and inspired so many people you know we may not have seen yet legislative action but were getting closer the house took a vote in the senate the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes a filibuster or passing common sense gun reform im going to choose common sense gun reform so i believe that were going to be able to get that done in 2021,1
Rachel Maddow, secretary castro thank you,1
Tim Ryan, rachel i have something to add to this briefly,1
Rachel Maddow, well give you 30 seconds for follow up on that question on that answer from secretary castro congressman ryan,1
Tim Ryan, you were talking about in the schools these kids are traumatized i support all the gun reforms here we need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have we need trauma based care in every school we need social and emotional learning in every school 90 of the shooters who do school shooting come from the school theyre in and 73 of them feel shamed traumatized or bullied we need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school that means a mental health counselor in every single school in the united states we need to start playing offense if our kids are so traumatized that theyre getting a gun and going into our schools were doing something wrong too and we need reform around trauma based care,1
Rachel Maddow, congressman thank you congressman ryan,1
Chuck Todd, congressman orourke youre a texan thats campaigned you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there what do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else okay but says you know what the democrats if i vote for them in there theyre going to take my gun away and even though i agree with you on all these other issues how do you have that conversation,1
Beto O’Rourke, heres how we had that conversation in texas i shared with them what i learned from those students who survived the santa fe high school shooting a young student named bri her friend marcel who survived another shooting the mother of a victim who lost her life rhonda heart they talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole we know that they save lives talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible they should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities red flag laws so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else theyre stopped before its too late,1
Beto O’Rourke, and what i found in each one of those 254 counties is that democrats and independents and republicans gun owners and nongun owners alike agreed but this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue those students from marjory stoneman douglas led the charge here in florida and theyve been able to change those laws theyre making our democracy work ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman orourke hang on let me give 30 seconds senator klobuchar the iron range im curious gun confiscation right if the government is buying back how do you not have that conversation,1
Amy Klobuchar, well thats not confiscation you would give them the offer to buy back their gun but ill say this i look at these proposals and i say does this hurt my uncle dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state these proposals dont do that when i was a prosecutor i supported the assault weapon ban when i was in the senate i saw those moms from sandy hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed and then now these parkland kids from florida they started literally a national shift you know why its just like with gay marriage when kids talk to their parents and their grandparents they say i dont understand why we cant put these sensible things in place they listen and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds its the best thing thatll ever happen we need to get this done,1
Chuck Todd, senator thank you senator thank you,1
Rachel Maddow, senator booker let me go to you on another matter actually senator mitch mcconnell says that his most consequential achievement as senate majority leader was preventing president obama from filling a supreme court seat having served with republicans on the judiciary committee do you believe they would confirm your court nominees,1
Cory Booker, im going to use 20 of my seconds just to say this one thing we dont all agree with when it comes to guns and i think its common sense and over 70 of americans agree with me if you need a license to drive a car you should need a license to buy and own a firearm and not everybody in this field agrees with that but in states like connecticut that did that they saw 40 drops in gun violence and 15 drops in suicides we need to start having bold agendas on guns,1
Cory Booker, when it comes to the supreme court very clearly we i agree with my friend secretary castro we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate this is a team sport whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like south carolina because we can elect jaime harrison they need to campaign in places like iowa because we can win a senate seat there this is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the senate and more so that we can not only balance the supreme court but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isnt so aggressive because most of america agrees with the policy objectives of our party,1
Rachel Maddow, mayor de blasio,1
John Delaney, we have to actually,1
Rachel Maddow, congressman delaney youll have some time in a moment on this issue,1
John Delaney, this issue is related to,1
Rachel Maddow, mayor de blasio as an executive in the largest city in this country you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen if you nominate a supreme court nominee as president of the united states and mitch mcconnell is still senate majority leader what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee,1
Bill De Blasio, rachel i am chief executive of the nations largest city and i also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question look i run the largest police force in america too and if were going to stop these shootings if were going to get these guns off the street we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community i also want to say that something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race and that is for the last 21 years ive been raising a black son in america and i have had to have very very serious talks with my son dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too as we saw recently in indiana,1
Bill De Blasio, so we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together weve done that in new york city and weve driven down crime while weve done it,1
Bill De Blasio, but to your question about mitch mcconnell theres a political solution that we have to come to grips with if the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states including red states to convince people were on their side we could put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward decent  deserve that right,1
Rachel Maddow, thank you mayor de blasio,1
Chuck Todd, senator warren im going to get you i will get you 30 seconds i promise let me get this question were trying i know you guys we got other issues were trying to get to including a big one coming up in a minute but senator warren i want to continue on the mitch mcconnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans,1
Elizabeth W., i do,1
Chuck Todd, do you have a plan for that okay we talked about the supreme court do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell if you dont beat him in the senate if hes still sitting there as the senate majority leader its very plausible youd be elected president with a republican senate do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell,1
Elizabeth W., i do we are a democracy and the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters now we for far too long have had a congress in washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country they have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and not made it work for the people well heres how i see this happening number one sure i want to see us get a democratic majority in the senate but short of the democratic majority in the senate you better understand the fight still goes on it starts in the white house and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come january 2021 we have to push from the outside have leadership from the inside and make this congress reflect the will of the people,1
Chuck Todd, okay im going to get a couple of you in here im going to get you a couple in here 30 seconds congressman delaney you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner mitch mcconnell doesnt operate that way he operates differently why do you think he is going to conform to your style,1
John Delaney, i think we need to get things done thats why i believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner listen ill sign into law bills that come to the white house that are passed on a party line basis absolutely but all the big transformative things weve ever done in this countrys history have happened when huge majorities of the american people get behind them which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises we need to put forth ideas that work whether its on healthcare creating universal healthcare so that every american gets healthcare but not running on making private insurance illegal the gun issue is related the gun safety issue is related because i cant tell you how many times ive been with folks in western maryland and theyve said to me you know democrats dont do anything for us republicans dont do anything for us you fight all the time so they vote on that single issue if we become the party of getting things done for the american people with real solutions no impossible promises,1
Chuck Todd, okay i understand senator booker hang on i promised 30,1
John Delaney, well be able to get all these things done,1
Chuck Todd, senator booker 30 seconds how do you deal with mitch youve been in the senate you cant get bills on the floor right now with mitch mcconnell presidents cant do it is president booker going to get his bills on the floor with senator mcconnell,1
Cory Booker, you know when i got to the united states senate going back to what de blasio said as an african american man in an african american dominated community i knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more african americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850 and when i got to the senate people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done as my colleagues in the senate know i fought on that bill from the day i got to the senate bill coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the first step act its not as far as i want to go but thousands of people will be liberated ive taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and ive been able to get things accomplished,1
Chuck Todd, thank you senator booker rachels got the next question,1
Rachel Maddow, we are going to hold on governor youre going to be happy with where we go,1
Chuck Todd, just give us a second,1
Rachel Maddow, governor inslee this next question is to you you got me you have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change it is first second and third priority for you youve said its all the issues lets get specific were here in miami which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise parts of miami beach and the keys could be underwater in our lifetimes does your plan save miami,1
Jay Inslee, yes first by taking away the filibuster from mitch mcconnell to start with we have to do that look look we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something about it our towns are burning our fields are flooding miami is inundated and we have to understand this is a climate crisis an emergency and it is our last chance in an administration next one to do something about it and we need to do what i have done in my state weve passed a 100 clean electrical grid bill we now have a vision statement my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work,1
Jay Inslee, but the most important thing on this and the biggest decision for the american public is who is going to make this the first priority and i am the candidate and the only one whos saying this has to be the top priority of the united states the organizing principle to mobilize the united states so that we can do what weve always done lead the world and invent the future and put eight million people to work thats what were going to do,1
Rachel Maddow, governor thank you governor,1
Chuck Todd, congressman orourke youve also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign you want some big changes in a pretty short period of time including switching to renewable energy pushing to replace gaspowered cars in favor of electric ones whats your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what youre trying to do but suddenly feels as if governments telling them how to live and ordering them how to live what is that balance like,1
Beto O’Rourke, i think youve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face thats why were traveling everywhere listening to everyone we were in pacific junction a town that had never meaningly flooded before just up against the missouri river in iowa and every home in that community had flooded there were farms just outside of pacific junction that were effectively lakes those farms already underwater in debt their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration and now they dont know what to do,1
Beto O’Rourke, we in our administration are going to fund resiliency in those communities in miami in houston texas those places that are on the front lines of climate change today were going to mobilize five trillion dollars in this economy over the next 10 years were going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and were going to put farmers and ranchers in the drivers seat renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide if all of us does all that we can then were going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential,1
Chuck Todd, 30 seconds secretary castro does who pays for the mitigation to climate whether its building sea walls for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldnt be living is this a federal government issue that needs to do that do they have to move these people what do you do about that where maybe theyre building a house someplace that isnt safe who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out,1
Julian Castro, well i dont think that that represents the vast majority of the issue in fact you know my first visit after i announced my candidacy wasnt to iowa or new hampshire it was to san juan puerto rico because people should know that if im elected president everybody will count and you know im one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience with a track record of getting things done when i was mayor of san antonio we moved our local public utility we began to shift it from coalfired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that and when i was hud secretary we worked on the national disaster resilience competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way thats the way that were going to help make sure that were all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change and if im elected president the first thing that i would do like senator klobuchar also said is sign an executive order recommitting us to the paris climate accord so that,1
Chuck Todd, congressman ryan i got a full question for you here which is simply this a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon taxing carbon in some way this type of proposal has been tried in a few places whether its washington state where voters voted it down youve had the yellow vest movement we had in australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer if pricing carbon is just politically impossible how do we pay for climate mitigation,1
Tim Ryan, well theres a variety of different ways to pay we talk about different ways of raising revenue and i think weve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this,1
Tim Ryan, but let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics we could talk about climate we could talk about guns we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about we have a perception problem with the democratic party we are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that i represent in ohio in the industrial midwest weve lost all connection we have got to change the center of gravity of the democratic party from being coastal and elitist and ivy league which is the perception to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years to get those workers back on our side so we can say were going to build electric vehicles were going to build solar panels but if you want to beat mitch mcconnell this better be a working class party if you want to go into kentucky and take his rear end out and if you want to take lindsey graham out you got to have blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in south carolina so all im saying here,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman ryan,1
Tim Ryan, all im saying here is,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman ryan,1
Tim Ryan, so all im saying is here if we dont address that fundamental problem,1
Chuck Todd, i understand,1
Tim Ryan, with our connection to workers white black brown gay straight working class people,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman,1
Tim Ryan, none of this is going to get done chuck,1
John Delaney, the questions about carbon tax bill,1
Chuck Todd, thank you very much were going to keep moving congressman delaney im going to get to you,1
John Delaney, i introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill to congress,1
Chuck Todd, 30 seconds go,1
John Delaney, all right all the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works you just have to do it right you cant put a price on carbon raise energy prices and not give the money back to the american people my proposal which is put a price on carbon give a dividend back to the american people it goes out one pocket back in the other,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman,1
John Delaney, i can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every democrat in the congress and the republicans who live in coastal states,1
Chuck Todd, congressman thank you,1
John Delaney, theres republicans in florida they actually care about this issue,1
Chuck Todd, thank you very much,1
John Delaney, this has got to be our way forward if were actually serious about this issue,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congresswoman gabbard were going to move here one of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the lgbtq community about your past stances and statements on gay rights after the trump administrations rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general trust you now,1
Tulsi Gabbard, well let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any american who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry my record in congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for lgbtq equality i serve on the equality caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that i grew up in a socially conservative home held views when i was very young that i no longer hold today ive served with lgbtq service members both in training and deployed downrange i know that they would give their life for me and i would give my life for them it is this commitment that ill carry through as president of the united states recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace still people who are unable to find a home for their families it is this kind of discrimination that we need to address,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congresswoman gabbard,1
Cory Booker, but its not enough its not enough if i could add to this its very important,1
Chuck Todd, 30 seconds senator,1
Cory Booker, this is not enough look civil rights is someplace to begin but in the african american civil rights community another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of african americans we do not talk enough about trans americans especially african american trans americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now we dont talk enough about how many children about 30 of lgbtq kids who do no go to school because of fear its not enough just to be on the equality act im an original cosponsor we need to have a president that will fight to protect lgbtq americans every single day from violence in our country,1
Chuck Todd, thank you senator booker,1
Tulsi Gabbard, senator booker senator booker,1
Rachel Maddow, senator klobuchar let me put this to you on the issue of civil rights for decades on the issue of civil rights and demographics honestly and politics for decades the democratic party has counted on african american voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level democrats are counting on the latino community now and in the future in the same way what have you done for black and latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if youre your partys nominee,1
Amy Klobuchar, my life and my career and my work in the senate has been about economic opportunity and to me this means better childcare for everyone in this country and when you want to have an economy that works you need to have retirement that works you need to have public schools that work and you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future the stem jobs in fact donald trump one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where i was the lead democrat okay thats a first up here was one that was about that making sure minority community members could share in those jobs,1
Amy Klobuchar, so to me this is about a few things its about an african american woman that goes to a hospital in new orleans says her hands are swollen and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies its about the fact that africanamerican women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes,1
Amy Klobuchar, so in short we need to one and i will do this in my first 100 days as president we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table everyone can vote in this country and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform senator booker and i worked on that first step act but we should go to the second step act which is to help all our communities across our country,1
Rachel Maddow, senator thank you very much 30 second follow up to you secretary castro this is a 70 latino city here in miami you are the only latino democrat who is running this year in the presidential race is that enough of an answer what senator klobuchar is describing there an economic justice agenda is that enough to mobilize latino voters to stand with the democratic party in a big way,1
Julian Castro, well i also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice you know i was in charleston not too long ago and i remembered that dylann roof went to the mother emmanuel ame church and he murdered nine people that were worshiping and then he was apprehended by police without incident well but what about eric garner and tamir rice and laquan mcdonald and sandra bland and pamela turner and antonio  im proud that im the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in america and make sure that no matter the color of your skin is that youre treated the same including latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police,1
Rachel Maddow, secretary castro thank you,1
Chuck Todd, let me go over to lester holt whos got a question i believe a viewer question,1
Lester Holt, and im over here chuck thanks we asked voters across the country to submit their questions to the candidates let me read one now this comes from john in new york who submitted this question he asks does the united states have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect american core interests id like to direct that question to congressman orourke,1
Beto O’Rourke, john i appreciate the question the answer is yes but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends when the united states presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer the kind of genocide that we saw in rwanda the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward but unfortunately under this administration president trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances hes diminished our standing in the world and hes made us weaker as a country less able to confront challenges whether its iran or north korea or vladimir putin in russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who president trump has offered another invitation to do the same hes embraced strong men and dictators at the expense of the great democracies as president i will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy i will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together that makes america stronger,1
Rachel Maddow, congressman orourke thank you,1
Bill De Blasio, what about the war powers act being a part of that equation with deep respect to the congressman look weve learned painful lessons as americans that weve gone to war without congressional authorization and look this is very personal for me i know the cost of war my dad served in the pacific in world war ii in the us army battle of okinawa had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars both physical and emotional and he did not recover he spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life and that battle didnt kill him but that war did and look even in the humanitarian crisis and i think we should be ready congressman to intervene god forbid there is a genocide but not without congressional approval democrats and republicans both in the congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval we learned a lesson in vietnam we seem to have forgotten the decisions have to be made by the united states congress in the name of the people,1
Rachel Maddow, im going to pick up on this point and i want to put this to congressman ryan today the taliban claimed responsibility for killing two american service members in afghanistan leaders as disparate as president obama and president trump have both said that they want to end us involvement in afghanistan but it isnt over for america why isnt it over why cant presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there and how could you,1
Tim Ryan, i appreciate that question so ive been in congress 17 years and 12 of those years ive sat on the armed services committee the defense appropriations committee or the armed services committee and the lesson that ive learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations nobody likes it its long its tedious but right now we have so i would say we must be engaged in this we must have our state department engaged we much have our military engaged to the extent they need to be but the reality of it is this president doesnt even have people appointed in the state department to deal with these things whether were talking about central america whether were talking about iran whether were talking about afghanistan weve got to be completely engaged and heres why because these flare ups distract us from the real problems in the country if were getting drones shot down for 130 million dollars because the president is distracted thats 130 million dollars that we could be spending in places like youngstown ohio or flint michigan or rebuilding,1
Rachel Maddow, congressman ryan congresswoman gabbard im going to give you 30 seconds actually to jump off what he said he described engagement as the problem,1
Tulsi Gabbard, is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in afghanistan well we just have to be engaged as a soldier i will tell you that answer is unacceptable we have to bring our troops home from afghanistan we are in a place in afghanistan where we have lost so many lives weve spent so much money money thats coming out of every one of our pockets money that should be going into communities here at home meeting the needs of the people here at home we are no better off in afghanistan today than we were when this war began this is why its so important to have a president commander in chief who knows the cost of war and whos ready to do the job on day one i am ready to do that job when i walk into the oval office,1
Chuck Todd, im going to go down the line here you know what you felt like she was responding you get 30 seconds go,1
Tim Ryan, thank you youre a very good man i appreciate it,1
Chuck Todd, fair enough i hear what youre saying,1
Tim Ryan, i would just say i dont want to be engaged i wish we were spending all this money in places that ive represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding but the reality of it is if the united states isnt engaged the taliban will grow and they will have bigger bolder terrorist acts we have got to have some presence there,1
Tulsi Gabbard, the taliban was there long before we came in theyll be there long before we leave,1
Tim Ryan, yeah exactly well they were and they were flying,1
Tulsi Gabbard, we cannot keep us troops deployed to afghanistan thinking that were going to somehow squash this taliban that has been there that every other country thats tried and failed,1
Tim Ryan, i didnt say squash them when we werent in there they started flying planes into our buildings so im just saying right now,1
Tulsi Gabbard, the taliban didnt attack us on 911 al qaeda did,1
Tim Ryan, well i understand,1
Tulsi Gabbard, al qaeda attacked us on 911,1
Tim Ryan, i understand that the taliban,1
Tulsi Gabbard, thats why i and so many other people joined the military to go after al qaeda not the taliban,1
Tim Ryan, the taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us all im saying is if we want to go in to elections and we want to say that we got to withdraw from the world thats what president trump is saying we cant i would love for us to,1
Tulsi Gabbard, you know whos protecting al qaeda right now saudi arabia,1
Chuck Todd, i want to go down the line here finish up foreign policy its a simple question what is our who is the geopolitical threat to the united states just give me a one word answer congressman delaney,1
John Delaney, can you repeat the question,1
Chuck Todd, greatest geopolitical threat to the united states right now congressman delaney,1
John Delaney, well the biggest geopolitical challenge is china but the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons,1
Chuck Todd, okay,1
John Delaney, you know those are different questions,1
Chuck Todd, i got you totally get it go ahead governor inslee,1
Jay Inslee, the biggest threat to security of the united states is donald trump theres no question,1
Chuck Todd, congresswoman gabbard,1
Tulsi Gabbard, the greatest,1
Chuck Todd, the greatest geopolitical threat,1
Tulsi Gabbard, the greatest threat that we face is the fact that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history,1
Chuck Todd, senator klobuchar,1
Amy Klobuchar, two threats economic threat china but our major threat right now is whats going on in the mideast with iran if we dont get,1
Chuck Todd, okay try to keep it to one or slimmer than what weve been going here one or two word,1
Beto O’Rourke, our existential threat is climate change we have to confront it before its too late,1
Chuck Todd, senator warren,1
Elizabeth W., climate change,1
Chuck Todd, yeah senator booker,1
Cory Booker, nuclear proliferation and climate change,1
Chuck Todd, secretary castro,1
Julian Castro, china and climate change,1
Chuck Todd, congressman ryan,1
Tim Ryan, china without a question theyre wiping us around the world economically,1
Chuck Todd, and mr mayor,1
Bill De Blasio, russia because theyre trying to undermine our democracy and theyve been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them,1
Chuck Todd, all right well thank you for that wide variety of answers and i mean that no i mean that in a thats what this debate is about this is the best part of a debate like this congressman orourke special council robert muellers report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by president trump house speaker pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the house if the house chooses not to impeach as president would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in mr muellers report,1
Beto O’Rourke, yes and ill tell you why,1
Chuck Todd, how by the way if the answer is yes,1
Beto O’Rourke, one of the most powerful pieces of art in the united states capital is the trumbull painting of general george washington resigning his commission to the continental congress at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people that has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years,1
Beto O’Rourke, if we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand so we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we followed them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy and if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our department of justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences there is accountability and there is justice its the only way that we save this country,1
Chuck Todd, thank you congressman orourke,1
Rachel Maddow, congressman delaney because of the accountability issues that congressman orourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which nancy pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the house it raises the prospect and the mueller report raises the prospect that president trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line no us president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office do you believe that president trump could or should be the first,1
John Delaney, i guess theres always a first,1
Rachel Maddow, should he be the first,1
John Delaney, i dont think anyones above the law i dont think anyone is above the law including a president i support speaker pelosis decisions that she is making in the house of representatives right now as speaker i think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined,1
Rachel Maddow, conceded on the issue of prosecution,1
John Delaney, i do think no ones above the law and this president who is lawless should not be above the law but i will tell you rachel the one thing when youre out doing as much campaigning as i have done 400 events all 99 counties in iowa this is not the number one issue the american people ask us about its not they want to know what were going to do for healthcare how we are going to lower pharmaceutical prices how we are going to build infrastructure what were going to do to create jobs in their communities you know last year in our country 80 of the money for startup businesses went to 50 counties in this country theres over 3000 counties in this country thats what they care about they care about whats going on in the public schools they care about whats going on with jobs in their communities with their pay with their healthcare with infrastructure these are the issues these kind of kitchen table pocketbook issues are actually what most americans care about they never ask about the mueller report,1
Rachel Maddow, understood congressman thank you your time is up,1

Bill De Blasio, it matters it matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didnt just talk about it but gave people 15 dollar minimum wage it matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken healthcare system and gave people universal healthcare it matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied prek and gave it to every single one of them for free,1
Bill De Blasio, these things really matter and these are the things that ive done in new york and i want to do the same for this whole country because putting working people first it matters we need to be that party again lets work together with your help we can put working people first again in america,1

Cory Booker, donald trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms we will beat him i will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again this is a referendum on him and getting rid of him but its also a referendum on us who we are and who we must be to each other its time we win this election and the way ill govern is by showing the best of who we are because thats what this country needs and deserves,1

Elizabeth W., but i got my chance it was a 50 dollar a semester commuter college that was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl and it opened my life i am in this fight because i believe that we can make our government we can make our economy we can make our country work not just for those at the top we can make it work for everyone and i promise you this i will fight for you as hard as i fight for my own family,1

Lester Holt, we certainly hope you will join us then but for now that concludes our coverage of this first democratic debate from miami for savannah jose chuck and rachel im lester holt have a good night everyone,1
Savanagh G., good evening to you,2
Savanagh G., youve called for big new government benefits like universal healthcare and free college in a recent interview you said you suspected that americans would be delighted to pay more taxes for things like that my question to you is will taxes go up for the middle class in a sanders administration and if so how do you sell that to voters,2
Bernie Sanders, okay well youre quite right we have a new vision for america and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of america while 500000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change real change and by that i mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a medicare for all single payer system,2
Bernie Sanders, under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now,2
Bernie Sanders, i believe that education is the future for this country and that is why i believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on wall street,2
Bernie Sanders, every proposal that i have brought forth is fully paid for,2
Savanagh G., senator sanders ill give you 10 seconds just to answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a sanders administration,2
Bernie Sanders, people who have healthcare on the medicare for all will have no premiums no deductibles no copayments no outofpocket expenses yes they will pay more taxes but less in healthcare for what they get,2
Savanagh G., thank you senator,2
Bennett, senator sanders ,2
Savanagh G., senator senator bennett were going to get to everybody i promise but let me just,2
Speaker 1, no id like to say some,2
Savanagh G., senator biden  promise everybodys going to get in here promise,2
Savanagh G., vice president biden senator sanders as you know has been calling for a revolution recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country you said we shouldnt demonize the rich you said nobody has to be punished no ones standard of living would change nothing would fundamentally change what did you mean by that,2
Joe Biden, what i meant by that is look donald trump thinks wall street built america ordinary middle class americans built american my dad used to have an expression he said joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck its about your dignity its about respect its being able to look your kid in the eye and say everythings going to be okay,2
Joe Biden, too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal what im saying is that weve got to be straight forward we have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it they have to make sure that we are in a situation where theres continuing education and theyre able to pay for it and they have to make sure that theyre able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink,2
Joe Biden, look donald trump has put us in a horrible situation we do have enormous income inequality the one thing i agree on is we can make massive cuts in the 16 trillion in tax loopholes out there and i would be going about eliminating donald trumps tax cuts for the wealthy,2
Savanagh G., vice president biden thank you,2
Savanagh G., senator harris theres a lot talk in this primary about new government benefits such as student loan cancellation free college healthcare and more do you think that democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal they make along those lines,2
Kamala Harris, well let me tell you something i hear that question but where was that question when the republicans and donald trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1 and the biggest corporations in this country contributing at least 1 trillion to the debt of america which middle class families will pay for one way or another,2
Kamala Harris, working families need support and need to be lifted up and frankly this economy is not working for working people for too long the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most which is why i am proposing that we change the tax code,2
Kamala Harris, so for every family that is making less than 100000 a year they will receive a tax credit that they can collect 500 a month which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support or not and on day one i will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 and the biggest corporations of america,2
Savanagh G., senator harris thank you,2
Savanagh G., governor hickenlooper let me get you in on this youve warned that democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism as you put it you were booed at the california democratic convention when you said that only one candidate on this stage senator sanders identifies himself as a democratic socialist what are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism,2
John H., well i think that the bottom line is if we dont clearly define that we are not socialists the republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists and if you look at the green new deal which i admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change im a scientist but we cant promise every american a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage i believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege but you cant expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people many of whom dont want to give it up,2
John H., in colorado we brought businesses and nonprofits together we got near universal healthcare coverage we were the first state in america to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address aggressively address methane emissions and we were also the first place to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis and we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 weve done the big progressive things that people said couldnt be done ive done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing,2
Savanagh G., all right governor thank you,2
Savanagh G., senator sanders ill give you a chance to weigh in here what is your response to those who say nominating a socialist would reelect donald trump,2
Bernie Sanders, well i think the responses at the polls the last poll i saw has us 10 points ahead of donald trump because the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the american people during his campaign,2
Bernie Sanders, he said he was going to stand up for working families well president trump youre not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their healthcare that they have and that 83 of your tax benefits go to the top 1 thats how we beat trump we expose him for the fraud that he is,2
Kirsten G., in answer,2
Savanagh G., senator,2
Kirsten G., i want to talk about,2
Savanagh G., senator gillibrand 30 seconds,2
Kirsten G., i disagree with both their perspectives the debate were having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is theres a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other and so all the things that were trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people,2
Kirsten G., if youre talking about ending gun violence its the greed of the nra and the gun manufacturers that make any progress possible its the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege,2
Savanagh G., senator gillibrand thank you,2
Kirsten G., so there need not be disagreement in the party because in truth we want healthy capitalism,2
Savanagh G., senator thank you,2
Kirsten G., we dont want corrupted capitalism,2
Savanagh G., thank you i want to be fair to all the candidates,2
Kirsten G.,  which is the definition of greed,2
Savanagh G., thank you,2
Savanagh G., senator bennett you have said its possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality you might as well call them candy were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that,2
Bennett, was that directed to me,2
Savanagh G., yes that was your quote,2
Bennett, oh thank you that sounded like me thank you,2
Savanagh G., it was you,2
Bennett, i appreciate it,2
Bennett, well look first of all i agree completely with bernie about what the fundamental challenge were facing as a country is 40 years of no economic growth for 90 of the american people 160000 families in the top 01 have the same wealth as the bottom 90 and weve got the worst income inequality that weve had in 100 years,2
Bennett, where i disagree is on his solution on medicare for all you know i have proposed getting to universal healthcare which we need to do it is a right healthcare is a right we need to get to universal healthcare i believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in america can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance,2
Bennett, i believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that,2
Bennett, ,2
Bennett, bernie  if i could just finish bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes vermont rejected medicare for all and we shouldnt be ,2
Kirsten G., in bernies bill,2
Savanagh G., whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa,2
Kirsten G., in bernies bill i wrote,2
Savanagh G., senator senator  we are going to talk about healthcare at length senator but for the moment my colleague jose,2
Jose, thank you very much,2
Savanagh G.,  wants to continue the question on the economy,2
Kirsten G., i wrote the part in senator sanders bill i wrote the part in senator sanders bill that is the transition which merges what the two senators said,2
Jose, senator,2
Kirsten G., because the truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period,2
Jose, senator,2
Kirsten G.,  you move us to single payer more quickly,2
Jose, senator we will get to this we will get to this,2
Speaker 2, i understand,2
Jose, before we do i want to say hello and good evening beunas noches to mayor buttigieg,2
Pete Buttigieg, beunas noches ,2
Jose, ,2
Jose, many of your colleagues on stage support free college you do not why not,2
Pete Buttigieg, sure college affordability is personal for us chasten and i have six figure student debt,2
Pete Buttigieg, i believe in reducing student debt its logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt i also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier,2
Pete Buttigieg, i just dont believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires i think the children of the wealthiest americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition and while i want tuition cost to go down i dont think we can buy down every last penny for them,2
Pete Buttigieg, now theres something else that doesnt get talked about in the college affordability debate yes it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college it also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college you should be able to live well afford rent be generous to your church and little league whether you went to college or not thats one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least 15 an hour,2
Eric Stalwell, jose ive got 100000 in student loan debt myself,2
Jose, let me get to you in a,2
Eric Stalwell, let me tell you we count on the people whove been in government for the last 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it its going to be the next generation the 40 million of us who cant start a family cant take a good idea and start a business and cant buy our first home this is the generation thats going to be able to solve student loan debt this generation is ready to lead,2
Jose, mr yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the united states 1000 a month no questions asked,2
Andrew Yang, thats right,2
Jose, i think thats like 32 trillion a year how would you do that,2
Andrew Yang, im sorry,2
Jose, how would you do that,2
Andrew Yang, oh so its difficult to do if you have companies like amazon trillion dollar tech companies paying literally zero in taxes while theyre closing 30 of our stores,2
Andrew Yang, now we need to put the american people in a position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy and if we had a value added tax at even half the european level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people families and communities up we would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods creating millions of jobs making our families stronger and healthier,2
Andrew Yang, wed save money on things like incarceration homelessness services emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger healthier mentally healthier population would increase gdp by 700 billion this is the move that we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of american jobs its why donald trump is our president today that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in michigan ohio and pennsylvania and wisconsin and were about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs call center jobs fast food jobs truck driving jobs and on and on through the account,2
Jose, so if i get you  understand a little bit better so youre saying 1000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that 1000 on value added tax,2
Andrew Yang, well the value added tax would end up  youd still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 of americans you have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up 12000 a year per individual so for the average family with two or three adults itd be 24000 to 36000 a year,2
Jose, okay congressman swalwell i want to talk a little bit about what mr yang is talking about it and you just actually mentioned that many americans are worried that things like self driving cars robots drones artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs what would you do to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world,2
Eric Swalwell, we must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than it displaces and ive seen the anxiety across america where the manufacturing floors go from a thousand to a hundred to one,2
Eric Swalwell, so we have to modernize our schools value the teachers who prepare our kids wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it invest in americas communities especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills,2
Eric Swalwell, but jose i was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the california democratic convention and said its time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans that candidate was then senator joe biden,2
Eric Swalwell, joe biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans 32 years ago hes still right today if were going to solve the issues of automation pass the torch if were going to solve the issues of climate chaos pass the torch if were going to solve the issue of student loan debt pass the torch if were going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school pass the torch,2
Jose, vice president would you like to sing a torch song,2
Joe Biden, i would im still holding on that torch i want to make it clear to you look the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on for an education,2
Joe Biden, the fact is that thats why i propose us focusing on schools that are in distress thats why i think we should triple the amount of money we spend for title 1 schools thats why i think we should have universal prek thats why i think every single person who graduates from high school 65 out of a 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education thats why there should be free community college cutting it in half the cost of college thats why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than 25000 a year their debt is frozen no interest payment until they get beyond that,2
Joe Biden, we cant put people in a position where they arent able to go on and move on so folks theres a lot we can do but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century were not doing that now,2
Jose, senator sanders ,2
Speaker 3, as the youngest guy on the stage i feel like i probably ought to contribute to the generational conversation,2
Speaker 3, ,2
Bernie Sanders, its part of joes generation,2
Speaker 3, im all for,2
Bernie Sanders, its part of joes generation,2
Kirsten G., before we move on,2
Bernie Sanders, let me respond,2
Kirsten G., before we move on from education,2
Bernie Sanders, the issue if i may say is not generational,2
Jose, please please senator sanders and ill let  we will,2
Bernie Sanders, the issue is not generational,2
Bernie Sanders, ,2
Bernie Sanders, the issue is who has the guts to take on wall street to take on the fossil fuel industry to take on the big money interests who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this county,2
Speaker 4, these issues ,2
Jose, senator harris,2
Kirsten G., ,2
Jose, i am so sorry we will let all of you speak,2
Jose, senator harris ,2
Jose, senator harris ,2
Jose, we will let you all speak senator harris,2
Speaker 5, we cant afford to wait for evolution on these issues,2
Speaker 6, part of the issue ,2
Kamala Harris, hey guys you know what america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how were going to put food on their table on that point part of the issue that is at play in america today and weve all been traveling around the country i certainly have im meeting people who are working two and three jobs you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right my great economy my great economy you ask him well how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market,2
Kamala Harris, well thats fine if you own stocks so many families in america do not you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers well yeah people in america are working theyre working two and three jobs so when we talk about jobs lets be really clear in our america no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table,2
Jose, thank you very much senator,2
Jose, youve all expressed an interest in talking about health care,2
Speaker 7, id like to say something if i might,2
Jose,  so lets talk about healthcare and this is going to be a show of hands question we asked a question ,2
Lester Holt, lets talk about healthcare this is going to be a show of hands question we asked a question about healthcare last night that spurred a lot of discussion as you know were going to do it again now many people watching at home have healthcare through their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan,2
Lester Holt, all right kirsten  senator gildebrand,2
Kirsten G., yeah so no its my turn,2
Speaker 8, go ahead,2
Kirsten G., this is a very important issue the plan that senator sanders and i other support medicare for all is how you get to single payer but it has a buyin transition period which is really important in 2005 when i ran for congress in a two to one republican district i actually ran on medicare for all and i won that two to one republican district twice,2
Kirsten G., the way i formulated it was simple anyone who doesnt have access to insurance they like they could buy in at a percentage of income they could afford thats what we put into the transition period for our medicare for all plan i believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right and not a privilege to single pair the quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers,2
Kirsten G., god bless the insurers if they want to compete they can certainly try but theyve never put people over their profits and i doubt they ever will what will happen is people will choose medicare you will transition we will get to medicare for all and then your step to single player is so short i would make it an earned benefit just like social security so that buy in your whole life,2
Lester Holt, all right,2
Kirsten G., it is always there for you and its permanent and its universal,2
Lester Holt, senator your time is up im going to put that same question to mayor buttigieg,2
Pete Buttigieg, yo weve taught look everybody who says medicare for all every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how youre actually supposed to get from here to there,2
Pete Buttigieg, and heres how i would do it its very similar i would call it medicare for all who want it you take something like medicare a flavor of that and you make it available on the exchanges people can buy in and then people like us are right that that will not only a more inclusive plan but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment,2
Pete Buttigieg, but lets remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like england even there theres still a private sector thats fine its just that for our primary care we cant be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system this is one is very personal for me i started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father i make decisions for a living,2
Pete Buttigieg, nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced but the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family because of medicare,2
Lester Holt, all right man,2
Pete Buttigieg, i want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right not live in ,2
Lester Holt, thank you your time is complete vice president biden i want to put the question to you you were one of the architects of obamacare so where do we go from here,2
Joe Biden, look this is very personal to me when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured i couldnt imagine what itd be like had i not had adequate healthcare available immediately then when my son came home from iraq after a year and was diagnosed with terminal cancer he was given months to live,2
Joe Biden, i cant fathom what would have happened if in fact they said by the way the last six months of your life youre on your own were cutting off youve used up your time the fact of the matter is that the quickest fastest way to do it is build on obamacare to build on what we did secondly to make sure that everyone does have any option,2
Joe Biden, everyone whether they have private insurance employer insurance or no insurance they in fact could buy in in the exchange to a medicarelike plan the way to do that you can do it quickly look urgency matters theres people right now facing what i faced and what we faced without any of the help i had we must move now i am against any democrat who opposes and tries to take down obamacare,2
Lester Holt, all right vice president biden youre time is,2
Joe Biden, and any republican who wants to get rid of obamacare ,2
Lester Holt, let me turn to senator sanders senator sanders you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a governmentrun plan none of the states that have tried something like that california vermont new york has struggled with it have been successful if politicians cant make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level how does this work,2
Bernie Sanders, listen i find it hard to believe that other major country on earth including my neighbor 50 miles north me canada somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man woman and child and in most cases theyre spending 50 per capita what we are spending lets be clear let us be very clear,2
Bernie Sanders, the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way the function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies last year if you could believe it while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and i will lower the prescription drug prices in half in this country top 10 companies made 69 billion dollars in profit,2
Bernie Sanders, they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars lying to the american people telling us why we cannot have a medicare for all ,2
Lester Holt, senator senator i just to have follow up there how do implement it on a national level,2
Bernie Sanders, im sorry,2
Lester Holt, how do you implement it on a national level given the fact its not succeeded in other states that have tried,2
Bernie Sanders, i will tell you how well do it well do it way real change has always taken place whether it was the labor movement the civil rights movement or the womens movement we will have medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone that healthcare is a human right not something to make huge profits off of,2
Lester Holt, okay all right ms williamson  excuse me excuse im addressing the question to ms williams weve been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare how would you lower the cost of prescription drugs,2
M. Williamson, well first of all the government should never had made the deal with the big pharma that they couldnt negotiate that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us you know i wanted to say that while im with senator bennet and others but i agree with almost everything here ill tell you one thing its really nice that weve got all these plans but if you think were going to beat donald trump by just having all these plans you got another thing coming because he didnt win by saying he had a plan he won by simply saying make america great again,2
M. Williamson, weve got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes as important as they are even if were just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we dont have a healthcare system in the united states we have a sickness care system in the united states we just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about whos going to pay for the treatment and how theyre going to be treated,2
M. Williamson, what we need to talk about is why so many americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries that gets back into not just the big pharma not just health insurance companies it has to do with chemical policies it has to do with environmental,2
Lester Holt, all right,2
M. Williamson, policies,2
Lester Holt, ms williams your time has expired,2
M. Williamson, it has to do with food policies it has to do with drug policies,2
Lester Holt, thank you,2
M. Williamson, it even has to do with the environmental policies,2
Lester Holt, senator bennet a question for you you want to keep the system that we have in place with obamacare and build out you mentioned that a moment ago is that enough to get us to universal coverage,2
Bennett, i believe that will get us the quickest way there and i thought the vice president was very moving about this and mayor pete as well i had prostate cancer recently as you may know and why i was a little race getting in the race the same week my kid had her appendectomy out and i feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice,2
Bennett, i think thats what the american people want i believe it will get us there quickly there are millions of people in america that do not have health insurance today because they cant theyre too wealthy they make too much money to be on medicaid they cant afford health insurance when senator sanders says that canada is single pair there are 35 million people in canada there are 330 million people in the united states easily the number of people on a public option,2
Bennett, it could easily be 35 million and for them it would be medicare for all as mayor buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it i think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go also,2
Kamala Harris, id like to add a point,2
Bennett, i will say bernie is a very honest person he has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will ban make illegal all insurance except cosmetic except insurance for i guess thats for plastic surgery everything else is banned under the medicare for all proposal but he is he ,2
Lester Holt, id let you go a little there but,2
Kamala Harris, id like to add a point,2
Lester Holt, obviously senator sanders you get a response,2
Kamala Harris, i would like to add a point here,2
Lester Holt, senator sanders hes going to respond to that,2
Bernie Sanders, just very briefly you know mike medicare is the most popular health insurance,2
Bennett, i agree,2
Bernie Sanders, program in the country people dont like their private insurance companies they like their doctors and hospitals under our plan people go to any doctor they want any hospital they want we will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in the country because well stop the greed of the insurance company ,2
Lester Holt, one at a time ,2
Kamala Harris, and the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and i will paraphrase there is any night in america a parent whos seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control calls 911 what should i do they say take the child to the emergency room,2
Kamala Harris, so they get in their car and they drive and theyre sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the forehead of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out of 500000 deductible  500000 deductible when they walk through those doors,2
Lester Holt, all right senator harris,2
Kamala Harris, thats what insurance companies are doing,2
Lester Holt, thank you ,2
Savanagh G., were going to continue this discussion i wanted to put it ,2
Eric Swalwell, im one of those parents i was just in the emergency room and im telling you,2
Savanagh G., congressman thank you,2
Eric Swalwell, we fight health insurance companies every single week,2
Savanagh G., thank you,2
Eric Swalwell, we stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs we have to have a healthcare guarantee if youre sick youre seen and in america you never go broke because of it,2
Savanagh G., okay a lot of you have been  talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that youve proposed in one form or another this is a show of hands question and hold them up for a moment so people can see raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants,2
Savanagh G., okay let me start with you mayor buttigieg why mayor buttigieg why,2
Pete Buttigieg, because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier remember were talking about something people are given a chance to buy into in the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay they pay sales taxes they pay property taxes directly or indirectly this is not about a handout this is an insurance program,2
Pete Buttigieg, and we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare but of course the real problem is we should have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship it makes no sense the american people agree on what to do this is the crazy thing if leadership consists of forming a consensus around a device of issue this white house has divided us around a consensus issue,2
Pete Buttigieg, the american people want a pathway to citizenship they wanted protections for dreamers we need to clean up the lawful immigration system like how my father immigrated to this country and as part of a comprise we can do whatever common sense measures are needed at the border,2
Savanagh G., mayor,2
Pete Buttigieg, but washington cant deliver on something the american people want what does that tell you about the system were living in it tells you,2
Savanagh G., mayor thank you,2
Pete Buttigieg, it needs profound structural reform,2
Savanagh G., vice president biden i believe you said that your healthcare plan would not cover undocumented immigrants could you explain your position,2
Joe Biden, im sorry beg your pardon i didnt hear,2
Savanagh G., i believe at the show of hands you did not raise your hand did you raise your hand,2
Joe Biden, oh no i did,2
Savanagh G., okay sorry sorry so you said that they would be covered under your plan,2
Joe Biden, yeah,2
Savanagh G., which is different than obamacare,2
Joe Biden, yes but heres the thing,2
Savanagh G., can you explain that change,2
Joe Biden, yes you cannot let as the mayor said you cannot let people who are sick no matter where they come from no matter what their status go uncovered you cant do that its just going to be taken care of period you have to its the humane thing to do,2
Joe Biden, but heres the deal the deal is that hes right about three things number one they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country but they also for example theyve increased the life span of social security because if they have a job theyre paying the social security tax thats what theyre doing its increasing the life span,2
Joe Biden, they would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until theyre an extremist the other thing is folks look we can deal with these insurance companies we can deal with the insurance companies by number one putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising which theyre doing on opioids what theyre doing paying doctors to prescribe,2
Joe Biden, we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on medicare that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are we can do this by making sure that were in a position that we in fact allow people,2
Lester Holt, your times up  hold off for a minute we need to take a short break here weve got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about so stick with us were just getting started well be back with more from miami right after this,2
Lester Holt, welcome back from miami jose is going to lead off the questioning in this round,2
Jose, thank you very much senator harris last month more than 130 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border many of them are being detained including small children in private detention centers in florida and throughout our country most of the candidates on this stage say the conditions of these facilities are abhorrent,2
Jose, on january 20 2021 if you are president what specifically would you do with the thousands of people who try to reach the united states every day and want a better life through asylum,2
Kamala Harris, immediately on january 20 2021 i will first off we cannot forget our daca recipients so im going to start there i will immediately by executive action reinstate daca status and daca protection to those young people i will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and have served our country and fought for our democracy,2
Kamala Harris, i will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum i will release children from cages i will get rid of the private detention centers and i will ensure that with this microphone that the president of the united states holds in her hand is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up separating them from,2
Kamala Harris, and not about locking children up separating them from their parents and i have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people a mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin through the entire country of mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that i will tell you because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse but what does donald trump do he says go back to where you came from that is not reflective of our america and our values and its got to end,2
Jose, governor hickenlooper governor hickenlooper day one at the white house how do you respond,2
M. Williamson, deal with these children,2
Jose, let me get to you in just a second,2
M. Williamson, im sorry,2
Jose, governor day one thousands of men women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life what do you do day one hour one,2
John H., certainly the images weve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by if youd ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents put them in cages actually put them up for adoption in colorado we call that kidnapping i wouldve told you it was unbelievable,2
John H., and the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is we make sure that there are sufficient facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families that children are with their families we have to make sure that ice is completely reformed and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where theyre addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border,2
John H., and we have to make sure ultimately that we provide not just shelter but food clothing and access to medical care,2
Jose, ms williamson,2
M. Williamson, yes what donald trump has done to these children and its not just in colorado governor youre right it is kidnapping and its extremely important for us to realize that if you forcibly take a child from their parents arms youre kidnapping them and if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them thats called child abuse this is called collective child abuse and when this is crime both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesnt make it less of a crime these are state sponsored crimes,2
M. Williamson, and what president trump has done is not only attack these children not only demonize these immigrants he is attacking a basic principle of americas moral core we open our hearts to the stranger this is extremely important and its also important for all of us remember and i have great respect for everyone who is on this stage but were going to talk about what to do about healthcare well where have you been guys because its not just a matter of a plan and i havent heard anybody on this stage who has talked about american foreign policy in latin america and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful,2
Jose, senator gillibrand what would you do as president with a reality,2
Kirsten G., well one of the worst things about president trump that hes done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are when he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died at his custody the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so i would do a few things first i would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship second i would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border i would have a community based treatment center where youre doing it within the communities where asylum seekers are given lawyers where theres real immigration judges not employees of the attorney general but appointed for life and have a community based system,2
Kirsten G., i would fund border security but the worst thing president trump has done is hes diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism cross border human trafficking drug trafficking and gun trafficking and hes given that money to the forprofit prisons i would not be spending money in forprofit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers,2
Jose, we had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border if youd be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation can we keep the hands up so we can see them,2
Pete Buttigieg, lets remember thats not just a theoretical exercise that criminalization that is the basis for family separation you do away with that its no longer possible of course it wouldnt be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong,2
Pete Buttigieg, weve got to talk about one other thing because the republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion now our party doesnt talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion,2
Pete Buttigieg, but we should call out hypocrisy when we see it and for a party that associates itself with christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that god would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents that god would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again,2
Jose, mr vice president i dont know if you raised your hand or were just asking to speak would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents,2
Joe Biden, the first thing i would do is unite families id surge immediately billions of dollars worth of help to the region immediately,2
Joe Biden, look i talk about foreign policy im the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign at the very end of our term to spend 740 million dollars to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place it was working we saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming the crisis was abated and along came this president and he said hed immediately discontinue that,2
Joe Biden, we all talk about these things i did it i did it 740 million now look second thing we have to do the law now requires that reuniting those families we would reunite those families period and if not wed put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents,2
Joe Biden, and lastly the idea that hes in court with his justice department saying children in cages do not need a bed do not need a blanket do not need a toothbrush that is outrageous and it should stop,2
Jose, vice president the obama biden administration deported more than three million americans my question to you is if an individual is living in the united states of america without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported,2
M. Williamson, no,2
Joe Biden, depending if they committed a major crime they should be deported president obama i think did a heck of a job to compare him to what this guy is doing is absolutely i find close to immoral,2
Joe Biden, but the fact is that look we should not be locking people up we should be making sure we change the circumstance as we did why they would leave in the first place and those who come seeking asylum we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them keep them safe until they can be heard,2
Jose, fifteen second if you wish to answer should someone who is here without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported,2
Joe Biden, that person should not be the focus of deportation we should fundamentally change the way we deal with things,2
Jose, senator,2
M. Williamson, i think its important,2
Bernie Sanders, i want to suggest that i agree with a lot of what kamala just said and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that trump has done,2
Bernie Sanders, number two picking up on the point that joe made we got to look at the root causes and you have a situation where honduras among other things is a failing state massive corruption youve got gangs who are telling families that if a ten year old does not join that gang that family is going to be killed,2
Bernie Sanders, what we have got to do on day one is invite the presidents and the leadership of central america and mexico together this is a hemisphere problem that we have got to address,2
Jose, thank you congressman swalwell what do you do,2
Eric Swalwell, day one,2
Jose, no if someone is here without documents and that is their only offense is that person to be deported,2
Eric Swalwell, no that person can be a part of this great american experience that person can contribute my congressional district is one of the most diverse in america and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and theyre not in the shadow economy,2
Eric Swalwell, day one for me families are reunited this president though for immigrants theres nothing he will not do to separate a family cage a child or erase their existence by weaponizing the census and there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that i will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together,2
Jose, senator harris,2
Kamala Harris, well thank you i will say no absolutely not they should not be deported and i actually this was one of the very few issues with which i disagreed with the administration with whom i otherwise had great relationship and a great deal of respect but on the secure communities issue i was attorney general of california i led the second largest department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice in a state of 40 million people and on this issue i disagreed with my president because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ices own definition were noncriminals,2
Kamala Harris, so as attorney general and the chief law officer of the state of california i issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safely of their community because what i saw and i was tracking it every day i was tracking it and saw that parents people who had not committed a crime even by ices own definition were being deported,2
Kamala Harris, but i have to add a point here the problem with this kind of policy and i know it as a prosecutor i want rape victim to be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her i want anybody who has been the victim of any real crime to be able to do that and not be afraid that if they do that they will be deported because the abuser will tell them it is they who is the criminal it is wrong it is wrong,2
Lester Holt, senator were going to turn to the issue of trade now if we can last night we asked the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the us four of them mentioned china us businesses say china steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse china of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low,2
Lester Holt, ill ask this to senator bennet to start off with how would you stand up to china,2
Bennett, i think that first of all the biggest threat to our national security right now is russia not china and second on china weve got competition because of what theyve done with our election in china i think the presidents been right to push back on china but has done it in completely the wrong way,2
Bennett, we should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on chinas mercantilist trade policies and i think we can do that,2
Bennett, id like to answer the other question before this as well,2
Lester Holt, you have the time,2
Bennett, when i see these kids at the border i see my mom because i know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in poland,2
Bennett, and for donald trump to be doing what hes doing to children and their families at the borders i say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive dream act thats every been conceived much less passed it got 68 votes in the senate that had 46 billion dollars of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security not a medieval wall,2
Lester Holt, senator your time,2
Bennett, and the president has turned the border of the united states into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is the statue of liberty which has brought my parents to this country to begin with we need to make a change,2
Lester Holt, mr yang let me bring you in on this on the issue of china you have expressed a lot of concerns about technology and taking jobs are you worried about china and if so how would you stand up against it,2
Andrew Yang, well i just want to agree that i think russia is our greatest geopolitical threat because theyve been hacking our democracy successfully and theyve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years so we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats,2
Andrew Yang, now china they do pirate our intellectual property its a massive problem but the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides i met with a farmer in iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in china thats now disappeared and gone forever and the beneficiaries have not been american workers or people in china its been southeast asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void,2
Andrew Yang, so we need to crack down on chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the way to go,2
Lester Holt, mayor buttigieg how would you stand up against china,2
Pete Buttigieg, first of all weve got to recognize that the china challenge really is a serious one this is not something to dismiss or wave away and if you look at what china is doing theyre using technology for the perfection of dictatorship but their fundamental economic model isnt going to change because of some tariffs,2
Pete Buttigieg, i live in the industrial midwest folks who arent in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where i live and manufacturers and especially soy farmers are hurting tariffs are taxes and americans are going to pay on average 800 dollars more a year because of these tariffs,2
Pete Buttigieg, meanwhile china is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence and this president is fixated on the kind of relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers weve got a much bigger issue on our hands,2
Pete Buttigieg, but in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions the biggest thing weve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness,2
Lester Holt, all right mayor thank you,2
Pete Buttigieg, if we disinvest in our own infrastructure education we are never going to be able to compete and if we really want to be an alternative a democratic alternative we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home and around the world,2
Lester Holt, thank you for your input,2
Savannah G., weve got a good debate so far were going to take a quick break here candidates when we come back the questioning continues with our colleagues chuck todd rachel maddow will be here much more with our candidates straight ahead,2
Chuck Todd, for this first debate weve heard from 10 of them from last night were hearing from 10 more tonight breakdown for each night was selected at random candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions 30 seconds for followups if necessary,2
Rachel Maddow, because of this large field of candidates not every person will be able to comment on everything but the less audience reaction there is the more time they will all get,2
Rachel Maddow, over the course of the next hour we will hear from all of these candidates but we are going to begin this hour with mayor buttigieg in the last five years civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system,2
Rachel Maddow, your community of south bend indiana has recently been in uproar over an officerinvolved shooting the police force in south bend is now 6 black in a city that is 26 black why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor,2
Pete Buttigieg, because i couldnt get it done my community is in anguish right now because of an officerinvolved shooting a black man eric logan killed by a white officer im not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back the officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didnt have his body camera on its a mess were hurting,2
Pete Buttigieg, i could walk you through all of the things we have done as a community all of the steps that we took from bias training to deescalation but it didnt save the life of eric logan when i look into his mothers eyes i have to face the fact that nothing that i say will bring him back,2
Pete Buttigieg, this is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that theres a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time not just from whats happened in the past but from whats happening around the country in the present,2
Pete Buttigieg, it threatens the wellbeing of every community i am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing a feeling not of fear but of safety,2
Rachel Maddow, thats time,2
Pete Buttigieg, i am determined to bring that day about,2
Rachel Maddow, thank you mr mayor,2
John H., mayor buttigieg  if i could ask one question just because i think ,2
Rachel Maddow, governor ill give you 30 seconds,2
John H., i think that the question theyre asking in south bend i think its seen across the country as why has it taken so long we had a shooting when i first became mayor 10 years before ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent moderates a civilian oversight commission we diversified the police force in two years we actually did deescalation training,2
John H., i think the real question that america should be asking is why five years after ferguson every city doesnt have this level of police accountability,2
Rachel Maddow, governor hickenlooper thank you,2
Pete Buttigieg, ive got to respond to that look weve taken so many steps towards police accountability the fop just denounced me for too much accountability were obviously not there yet i accept responsibility for that because i am in charge,2
John H.,  camera wasnt on and that was a policy and you should fire the chief,2
Pete Buttigieg, under indiana law this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved,2
John H., but youre the mayor you should fire the chief if thats the policy and someone died,2
Marianne W., all of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics there are symptoms the underlying cause has to do with deep deep deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system,2
Marianne W., the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason i do not believe that the average american is a racist but the average american is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the united states,2
Rachel Maddow, ms williamson thank you very much ,2
Chuck Todd, vice president biden were going to get to you hang on were going to get ,2
Kamala Harris,  stage i would like to speak on the issue of race,2
Rachel Maddow, senator harris ,2
Kamala Harris, what i will say is that i ,2
Rachel Maddow, preface this we will give you 30 seconds were going to come back to you on this again in just a moment go for 30 seconds,2
Kamala Harris, okay on the issue of race i couldnt agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly there is not a black man i know be he a relative a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination,2
Kamala Harris, growing up my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said couldnt play with us because we were black,2
Kamala Harris, i will say also that in this campaign weve also heard  im going to now direct this at vice president biden i do not believe you are a racist i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,2
Kamala Harris, i also believe  its personal it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,2
Kamala Harris, it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools she was bused to school every day that little girl was me,2
Kamala Harris, i will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats we have to take it seriously we have to act swiftly as attorney general of california i was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on,2
Rachel Maddow, senator harris thank you vice president biden you have been invoked we are going to  chance to respond vice president biden,2
Joe Biden, its a mischaracterization of my position across the board i do not praise racists that is not true number one number two if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether i did or not im happy to do that,2
Joe Biden, i was a public defender i didnt become a prosecutor i came out and i left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact my city was in flames because of the assassination of dr king number one,2
Joe Biden, now number two as the vice president of the united states i work with a man who in fact we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major major way,2
Joe Biden, the fact is in terms of busing the busing i never  you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council thats fine thats one of the things i argued for that we should be breaking down these lines,2
Joe Biden, the bottom line here is look everything ive done in my career  i ran because of civil rights i continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights those civil rights by the way include not just only africanamericans but the lgbt community,2
Kamala Harris, vice president biden do you agree today do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america then,2
Joe Biden, no,2
Kamala Harris, do you agree,2
Joe Biden, i did not oppose busing in america what i opposed is busing ordered by the department of education thats what i opposed i did not oppose ,2
Kamala Harris, well there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in america i was part of the second class to integrate berkeley california public schools almost two decades after brown v board of education,2
Joe Biden, because your city council made that decision it was a local decision,2
Kamala Harris, thats where the federal government must step in,2
Joe Biden, ,2
Kamala Harris, thats why we have the voting rights act and the civil rights act thats why we need to pass the equality act thats why we need to pass the era because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people,2
Joe Biden, i have supported the era from the very beginning when i ran ,2
Chuck Todd, okay vice president biden 30 seconds because i want to bring other people into this,2
Joe Biden, i supported the era from the very beginning im the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years we got to the place where we got 98 of the 98 votes in the united states senate doing it ive also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box i agree that everybody wants  anyway my time is up im sorry,2
Chuck Todd, thank you vice president,2
Marianne W., all of these things have to do ,2
Chuck Todd, senator sanders senator sanders im going to go to you on this you said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for not a candidates race or age or sexual orientation many democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last nights stage and the perspective that diversity brings to this contest and to these issues are you telling democratic voters that diversity shouldnt matter when they make this decision,2
Bernie Sanders, no absolutely not unlike the republican party we encourage diversity we believe in diversity thats what america is about in addition to diversity in terms of having more women more people from the lgbt community we also have to do something else,2
Bernie Sanders, that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question how come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 has seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth,2
Bernie Sanders, we need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country,2
Chuck Todd, senator gillibrand i want to give you 30 seconds on this,2
Kirsten G., well first of all where bernie left off weve heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in politics the fact that washington is run by the special interests you are never going to solve any of these problems,2
Kirsten G., i have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections to have clean elections,2
Kirsten G., if we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism we can take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs washington,2
Joe Biden, the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when i was a young senator,2
Chuck Todd, thank you vice president we want to shift topics here senator bennet the next question is for you on the issue of partisan gridlock president obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection republicans would want to work with democrats the fever would break that did not happen,2
Chuck Todd, now vice president biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together should voters believe that somehow if theres a democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear,2
Michael Bennet, gridlock will not magically disappear as long as mitch mcconnell is there first second thats why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to win the senate as well,2
Michael Bennet, thats why we have to propose policies that can be supported like medicare so that we can build a broad coalition of americans to overcome broken washington dc i agree with what senator gillibrand was saying i share a lot of her views,2
Michael Bennet, we need to end gerrymandering we need to end political gerrymandering in washington the court today said they couldnt do anything about it we need to overturn citizens united the court was the one that gave us citizens united and the attack on voting rights in shelby vs holder is something we need to deal with,2
Michael Bennet, all of those things has happened since vice president biden was in the senate we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition its the only way we can do it we need to root out the corruption in washington expand peoples right to get to the polls and i think then we can succeed,2
Chuck Todd, vice president biden 30 seconds it does sound as if you havent seen whats been happening in the united states senate over the last 12 years it didnt happen why,2
Joe Biden, i have seen what happened just since we were vice president we needed three votes to pass an 800 recovery act that kept us from going into a depression i got three votes changed we needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt i got mitch mcconnell to raise taxes 600 billion by raising the top rate,2
Joe Biden, as recently as after president got elected i was able to put together a coalition of  that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan,2
Joe Biden, sometimes you cant do that sometimes you just have to go out and beat them i went into 20 states over 60 candidates and guess what we beat them we won back the senate,2
Chuck Todd, thank you,2
Michael Bennet, chuck the problem with what the vice president ,2
Chuck Todd, 30 seconds,2
Michael Bennet, no the problem ,2
Chuck Todd, 30 seconds go ahead,2
Michael Bennet, sometimes you do have to beat them but the deal that he talked about with mitch mcconnell was a complete victory for the tea party it extended the bush tax cuts permanently the democratic party had been running against that for 10 years we lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester that was a great deal for mitch mcconnell it was a terrible deal for america,2
Kirsten G., ,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator bennet,2
Kirsten G., ,2
Chuck Todd, go ahead 30 seconds,2
Kirsten G., you heard from the republicans that the reason why the trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors you heard it they actually said those words,2
Kirsten G., the corruption in washington is real it is something that makes every one of the plans weve heard about over the last several months impossible i have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections publiclyfunded elections,2
Kirsten G., we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters not into the koch brothers we were talking about issues were in florida imagine the parkland kids having as much power in our democracy as the koch brothers or the nra imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than anyone else because their voice is needed ,2
Chuck Todd, senator gillibrand im trying to get everybody in here,2
Kirsten G., as president its the first thing im going to do because nothing else is possible whether its education or healthcare or ending institutional racism,2
Chuck Todd, thank you very much,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders id like to put a different question to you roe vs wade has been the law of the land since 1973 now that there is a conservative majority on the supreme court several republican controlled states have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion,2
Rachel Maddow, one of those laws could very well make it to the supreme court during your presidency if you are elected president what is your plan if roe is struck down in the court while youre president,2
Bernie Sanders, well my plan as somebody who believes for a start that a womans right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right we will do everything we can to defend roe vs wade,2
Bernie Sanders, second of all let me make a promise here you ask about a litmus test my litmus test is i will never appoint nominate any justice to the supreme court unless that justice is 100 clear he or she will defend roe v wade,2
Bernie Sanders, third of all i do not believe in packing the court we got a terrible 54 majority conservative court right now i do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts that brings new blood into the supreme court and a majority i hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run ,2
Rachel Maddow, hold on im going to give you 10 additional seconds because the question is what if the court has already overturned roe and roe is gone all of the things you just described would be to try to preserve roe if roe is gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights,2
Bernie Sanders, well first of all let me tell you this it didnt even come up yet but lets taste this medicare for all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it,2
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator,2
Kirsten G., can i just address this for a second i want to talk directly directly to americas women and the men who love them womens reproductive rights are under assault by president trump and the republican party 30 states are trying to overturn roe v wade right now,2
Kirsten G., it is mindboggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights i think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption and the deal making when the door is closed and the negotiations are made there are conversations about womens rights and compromises have been made on our backs thats how we got to hyde thats how the hyde amendment was created a compromise by leaders of both parties,2
Kirsten G., then we have the aca during the aca negotiation i had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasnt sold down the river or abortion services what we need to know is  imagine this one question when we beat president trump and mitch mcconnell walks into the oval office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for womens rights,2
Kirsten G., i have been the fiercest advocate for womens reproductive freedom for over a decade i promise you as president when that door closes i will guarantee womens reproductive freedom no matter what,2
Rachel Maddow, senator thank you,2
Chuck Todd, thank you were moving to climate were moving to climate guys senator harris im addressing you first on this you live in a state that has been hit by drought wildfires flooding climate change is a major concern for voters in your state its pretty obvious obviously the state as well,2
Chuck Todd, last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals explain specifically what yours is,2
Kamala Harris, well first of all i dont even call it climate change its the climate crisis it represents an existential threat to us as a species the fact that we have a president of the united states who has embraced science fiction over science fact would be to our collective peril,2
Kamala Harris, i visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in california i spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning,2
Kamala Harris, on this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now that is why i support a green new deal it is why i believe on day one and as president i will reenter us in the paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously,2
Kamala Harris, frankly we have a president of the united states  we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the united states its donald trump,2
Kamala Harris, im going to tell you why im going to tell you why because i agree climate change represents an existential threat he denies the science you want to talk about north korea a real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what does he do he embraces kim jongun a dictator for the sake of a photo op putin you want ,2
Kamala Harris, a dictator for the sake of a photo op,2
Chuck Todd, thank,2
Kamala Harris, putin you want to talk about russia,2
Chuck Todd, senator harris were going to do,2
Kamala Harris, he takes the word of the russian president,2
Chuck Todd, i want to stick to climate,2
Kamala Harris, over the word of the american intelligence,2
Chuck Todd, i want to stick to climate here,2
Kamala Harris, community when it comes to a threat to our democracy,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator,2
Kamala Harris, and our elections,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator harris,2
Kamala Harris, these are the issues that are before us chuck,2
Chuck Todd, i hear you,2
Kamala Harris, yes,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator harris mayor buttigieg in your climate plan if youre elected president in your first term how is this going to help farmers impacted by climate change in the midwest,2
Pete Buttigieg, well the reality is we need to begin adapting right away but we also cant skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse its why we need aggressive and ambitious measures its why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend but i would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the american people in a progressive fashion so that most americans are made more than whole,2
Pete Buttigieg, this isnt theoretical for us in south indiana parts of california on fire right here in florida theyre talking about sea level rise well in indiana i had to activate the emergency operations center of our city twice in less than two years first time was a 1000 year flood and the next time was a 500 year flood this is not just happening on the arctic ice caps this is happening in the middle of the country and weve got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward,2
Pete Buttigieg, now heres what very few people talk about first of all rural american can be part of the solution instead of being told theyre part of the problem with the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments rural america could be a huge part of how we get this done secondly we got to look to the leadership of local communities those networks of mayors,2
Chuck Todd, mayor,2
Pete Buttigieg, of cities from around the world who,2
Chuck Todd, im trying to stick to the topic as best we can,2
Pete Buttigieg, have come together not even waiting for our national governments to catch up we should have a pittsburgh summit where we bring them together as well as rejoining the paris,2
Chuck Todd, thank you mayor buttigieg,2
Rachel Maddow, i want to bring governor hickenlooper into this for a moment governor you have said that oil and gas companies should be a part of the solution on climate change lots of your colleagues on stage tonight have talked about moving away from fossil fuels entirely can oil and gas companies be real partners in this fight,2
John H., well i share the sense of urgency im a scientist so i recognize that within 10 or 12 years of actually suffering irreversible damage but you know guaranteeing everybody a government job is not going to get us there socialism in that sense is not the solution we have to look at what really will make a difference,2
John H., in colorado were closing a couple coal plants replacing them with wind solar and batteries and the monthly bills go down weve building a network for electric vehicles we are working with the oil and gas industry and we created the first methane regulations in the country methane is 25 times worse than co2 then weve got to get to that last part i mean the industrial heavy industry we havent seen the plans yet,2
John H., if you look at the real problems co2 the worst polluters in co2 was china it was the united states and then its concrete and its extallation beyond that i think weve got to recognize that only by bringing people together businesses nonprofits we cant demonize every business weve got to bring them together to be part of this thing because ultimately,2
Rachel Maddow, governor,2
John H., if were not able to do that we will be doomed to failure we have no way of doing this without,2
Rachel Maddow, governor thank you vice president biden on the issue of how you do this democrats are arguing robustly among themselves about whats the best way to tackle climate change but if were honest many republicans including the president are still not sure if they believe it is even a serious problem so are there significant ways you can cut carbon emissions if you have to do it with no support from congress,2
Joe Biden, the answer is yes number one when our administration we built the largest wind farm in the world the largest solar energy facility in the world we drove down the price competitive price of both of those renewable sources i would immediately insist that we in fact build 500000 recharging stations throughout the united states of america working with governors mayors and others so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2030,2
Joe Biden, i would make that we invested 400 million dollars in new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy but economy that can create millions of jobs but i would immediately rejoin the paris climate accord i would up the ante in that accord which it calls for because we make up 15 of the problem 85 of the world makes up the rest we have to have someone that knows how to corral the rest of the world bring them together and get something done like we did in our administration,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders i want to give you 30 seconds to follow up but im going to hold you to 30,2
Bernie Sanders, look the old ways are no longer relevant the scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet this is a global issue what the president of the united states should do is not deny the reality of climate change but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction let us get together for the common enemy and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy,2
Rachel Maddow, thank you,2
Bernie Sanders, the future of the planet rests on us doing that ,2
Rachel Maddow, before we leave this topic,2
Pete Buttigieg, heres the solution pass the torch pass the torch to the generation thats going to feel the effects of climate change,2
Bernie Sanders, take on the fossil fuel ,2
Rachel Maddow, before we leave this topic heres something you all want to weigh in on hold one moment,2
Kamala Harris, campaigns of the republican party,2
Rachel Maddow, hold one moment,2
Chuck Todd, just trust us on this,2
Marianne W., and the fact that somebody has a younger body doesnt mean you have old ideas ,2
Marianne W., john kennedy did not say i have a plan to get a man to the moon and were going to do it and i think we can all work together and maybe we can get a man on the moon john kennedy said by the end of this decade we are going to put a man on the moon because john kennedy was back in the day when politics included the people and included imagination and included great dreams and included great plans,2
Rachel Maddow, ms williamson,2
Chuck Todd, thank you ms williamson,2
Marianne W., and i have had a career not making the political plans but i have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people,2
Chuck Todd, thank you ms williamson,2
Marianne W., masses of people when we know that when we say,2
Chuck Todd, thank you,2
Marianne W., we are going to turn from a dirty economy,2
Chuck Todd, thank you,2
Marianne W., to a clean economy were going to have a green new deal were going to create millions of jobs were going to do this within the next 12 years because im not interested in just winning the next election we are interested,2
Chuck Todd, thank you ms williamson,2
Marianne W., in our grandchildren,2
Chuck Todd, all right were going to sneak in a break in a minute but before we go im going to go down the line here and im asking you please for one or two words only all right please,2
Rachel Maddow, really,2
Chuck Todd, president obama in his first year wanted to address both healthcare and climate he could only get one signature issue accomplished it was obviously healthcare he didnt get to do climate change you may only get one shot in your first issue that youre going to push you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed what is that first issue for your presidency eric swalwell youre first,2
Eric Swalwell, for parkland for orlando for every community affected by gun violence ending gun violence,2
Chuck Todd, senator bennet,2
Michael Bennet, climate change and the lack of economic mobility bernie talks about,2
Chuck Todd, senator gillibrand,2
Kirsten G., passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan universal prek affordable daycare and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are,2
Kamala Harris, oh i like that okay,2
Chuck Todd, senator harris ,2
Kamala Harris, passing a middleclass working families tax cut,2
Chuck Todd, thats one,2
Kamala Harris, daca guns,2
Chuck Todd, okay  senator sanders first thing,2
Bernie Sanders, i reject the premise that theres only one or two issues out there this country,2
Chuck Todd, im not saying there isnt one or two,2
Bernie Sanders, this country faces enormous crises,2
Chuck Todd, senator sanders,2
Bernie Sanders, we need a political revolution people have got to stand up,2
Chuck Todd, okay,2
Bernie Sanders, and take on the special interests we can transform this country,2
Chuck Todd, fine vice president biden your first issue mr vice president,2
Joe Biden, i think youre so underestimating what barack obama did hes the first man to bring together the entire world 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately so i dont buy that but the first thing i would do is make sure that we defeat donald trump,2
Chuck Todd, okay,2
Joe Biden, period,2
Chuck Todd, mayor buttigieg your first priority your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle,2
Pete Buttigieg, we got to fix our democracy before its too late get that right climate immigration taxes and every other issue gets better,2
Chuck Todd, mr yang,2
Andrew Yang, i would pass a 1000 freedom dividend for every american adult starting at age 18 which would speed us up on climate change because if you get the boot off of peoples throats theyll focus on climate change much more clearly,2
Chuck Todd, governor hickenlooper,2
John H., i would do a collaborative approach to climate change and i would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we dont reelect the worst president in american history,2
Chuck Todd, and ms williamson with the last one,2
Marianne W., my first call is to prime minister of new zealand who said that her goal is to make new zealand the place where its the best place in the world for a child to grow up i would tell her girlfriend you are so on because the united states of america is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up,2
Rachel Maddow, ms williamson,2
Chuck Todd, thank you you guys were close with the at least it was shorter,2
Rachel Maddow, no they werent,2
Chuck Todd, responses,2
Rachel Maddow, not at all,2
Chuck Todd, all right c minus,2
Rachel Maddow, were going to take a quick break well be right back with these candidates right after this,2
Steve Kornacki, all right well on election day 2020 donald trump will be something he was not on election day 2016 that is president donald trump and incumbent running for reelection in some ways a reelection campaign for a president of course becomes a referendum on how folks feel the president did during his four years in office,2
Steve Kornacki, so what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the trump presidency well what you see here this is his average approval rating meaning youve always got these different polls out there one day nbc will have one the next day cnn will have one theyre always coming in from all over the place this trend line is an average a daytoday average of all of those polls put together what you see here in this trend line is its a very narrow range that trump is operating in what i mean by that is look at this this is his high watermark his peak as president his average approval rating at its best 46 when was this early february 2017 that was his honeymoon he had just become president that makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60 65 70 at least for a short period they all had honeymoons trumps honeymoon he couldnt even crack 50 so already we see a lower ceiling for trump than weve seen with past presidents but that comes with a flip side,2
Steve Kornacki, that is the basement for trump look at this 37 is the low point hes hit in his average approval rating as president that is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone weve seen nixon bush senior carter we saw them fall into the 20s at some point during their term that has not happened to trump either 37 on the low end 46 on the high end right now somewhere in between its a very narrow range it speaks to polarization ill tell you it speaks to something else,2
Steve Kornacki, is this presidency really any different politically in terms of how its being received than the campaign in 2016 because compare this trend line 46 37 low high compare that to trumps support against hillary clinton in the polls in the fall of 2016 trumps average support at a low point 36 at a high point about 435 of course on election day what was the number he hit 46 the same high watermark hes had in his approval rating so trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate as president we say it speaks to polarization,2
Steve Kornacki, it also speaks to look this is somebody who succeeded as candidate in 2016 despite some very very high negative numbers what i mean by that is look at this the exit poll on election day do you think donald trump is qualified to be president only 38 said they thought he was qualified for the job the clear majority said trump wasnt qualified does he have the temperament 35 said he had the temperament do you like him do you have a favorable view only 40 did youre not supposed to be able to win with those numbers trump was one of the big reasons his opponent hillary clinton by election day 2016 almost as unpopular as he was only 43 favorable it created that narrow path for trump and that becomes the question when you look at that approval rating now in 2020 can he make his opponent as unpopular on election day as clinton was in 16,2
Rachel Maddow, welcome back to the democratic candidates debate in miami were going to continue the questioning now with lester in the audience we are,2
Chuck Todd, just,2
Rachel Maddow, we are in a second are going to have a question from lester in the audience but that was just a fake out,2
Chuck Todd, were going to go to the issue of guns and,2
Rachel Maddow, congressman swalwell among this field of candidates you have a unique position on gun reform youre proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in america and it should be mandatory how do you envision that working especially in states where gun rights are a strong flashpoint,2
Eric Swalwell, keep your pistols keep your rifles keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people we have the nra on the ropes because of the moms because of the brady group because of giffords because of march for our lives but im the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in america ive seen the plans of the other candidates here they would all leave 15 million assault weapons in our communities they wouldnt do a single thing to save a single life in parkland ill approach this issue as a prosector ill approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what theyre wearing so we remember it in case we have to identify them later a generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually look where the fire exits are,2
Eric Swalwell, we dont have to live this way we must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders a vermont newspaper,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders a vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said my own view on guns is everything being equal states should make those decisions,2
Bernie Sanders, no,2
Rachel Maddow, has your thinking changed since then do you now think theres a federal role to play,2
Bernie Sanders, thats a mischaracterization of my thinking,2
Rachel Maddow, its a quote of you,2
Bernie Sanders, look we have a gun crisis right now 40000 people a year are getting killed in 1988 rachel when it wasnt popular i ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact lost that race for congress i have a d minus voting record from the nra and i believe that what we need is comprehensive gun legislation that among other things provides universal background we end the gun show loophole we end the straw man provision i believed in 1988 and i believe today that assault weapons  are weapons are from the military and that they should not be on the streets of america,2
Eric Swalwell, your plan leaves them on the streets you leave 15 million on the streets,2
Bernie Sanders, we ban the sale and distribution,2
Eric Swalwell, will you buy them back,2
Bernie Sanders, and thats what i believed for many years,2
Eric Swalwell, will you buy them back,2
Bernie Sanders, if the government wants to do that if people want to bring them back,2
Eric Swalwell, youre going to be the government will you buy them back,2
Bernie Sanders, yes,2
Rachel Maddow, senator harris were going to give you 30 seconds,2
Kamala Harris, thank you i think your idea is a great one congressman swalwell i will say that there a lot of great ideas the problem is congress has not had the courage to act which is why when elected president of the united states i will give the united states congress 100 days to pull their act together bring all these good ideas together and put a bill on my desk for signature if they do not i will take executive action and i will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy weve had i will require the atf to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law and i will ban by executive order the importation of assault weapons because im going to tell you as a prosecutor i have seen more autopsy photographs than i care to tell you i have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims i have attended more police officer funerals it is enough it is enough there have been plenty of good ideas from members of the united states congress theres been no action as president i will take action,2
Rachel Maddow, mayor buttigieg i want to bring you in on this sir a lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often shorthanded as military style weapons youre the only person on this stage tonight with military experience as veteran of the afghanistan war will military families does that inform you thinking on this view do you believe that military families or americans veterans will at large have a different take on this than the other americans who weve been talking about and who congressman swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program,2
Pete Buttigieg, yes of course because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons look every part of my life experience informs this being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence we lose as many as were lost at parkland every two or three years in my city alone this is tearing communities apart,2
Pete Buttigieg, if more guns made us safer wed be the safest country on earth it doesnt work that way common sense measures like universal background checks cant seem to get delivered by washington even when most republicans let alone most americans agree its the right thing to do as somebody who trained on weapons of war i can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in american cities or neighborhoods in peace time ever,2
Rachel Maddow, vice president biden 30 seconds,2
Joe Biden, a real 30 seconds,2
Rachel Maddow, a real 30 seconds,2
Joe Biden, okay im the only person thats beaten the nra nationally im the guy that got the brady bill passed the background checks number one number two we increase that background check  during the obamabiden administration im also the only guy that got assault weapons banned banned and the number of clips in a gun banned so folks look and i would buyback those weapons we already started talking about that we tried to get it done i think,2
Joe Biden,  as weapons we already started talking about that we tried to get it done i think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it and thats a good expenditure of money and lastly we should have smart guns no gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger its within our right to do that we can do that our enemy is the gun manufacturers not the nra the gun manufacturers,2
Rachel Maddow, vice president thank you,2
Speaker 1, but the nra is taking orders from the gun manufacturer thats the problem,2
Chuck Todd, all right lester holt has our next question lester take it away,2
Lester Holt, all right chuck  this is a question from our viewers we put some suggestions that asked maybe they could share some heres one that came from  from canby oregon who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and in the process on our reputation abroad the question is what do you see as important early steps in reversing the damage done and well put this one to senator bennet,2
Michael Bennet, thank you very much what an excellent question first of all we have to restore our democracy out home the rest of the world is looking for us for leadership we have a president who doesnt believe in the rule of law he doesnt believe in freedom of the press he doesnt believe in independent judiciary he believes in the corruption that hes brought to washington dc and that is what we have to change and thats why everybody is up here tonight and i appreciate the fact that theyre up here for that reason,2
Michael Bennet, second weve got to restore the relationships that hes destroyed with our allies not just in europe he flew to the g20 last night and attacked japan germany and a third ally of ours without saying anything about north korea or russia when youve got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the straits of hormuz and the whole world doesnt know whether to believe it or not that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the united states of america,2
Chuck Todd, this is a perfect time,2
Michael Bennet, and we need to change that,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator that is a perfect for me to do another one of these down the line and this is what this question is which is you got to have to  youre likely going to have to reset a relationship between america and another country or entity if you become president because of perhaps because of some relationship that you just mentioned about president trump what is the first relationship you would like to reset as president im going to go mrs williamson,2
Marianne W., well one of my first phone calls would be to call the european leaders and say were back because i totally understand,2
Chuck Todd, thank you,2
Marianne W.,  that the united states be part of the western alliance,2
Chuck Todd, okay im trying to get one or two words here i hear you governor hickenlooper,2
John H., you know i talk about constant engagement and i think the first county i would go to and i understand theyve been cheating and stealing and ultra poverty would be china,2
Chuck Todd, okay,2
John H., because if youre going to deal with public health pandemics,2
Chuck Todd, thank you,2
John H.,  and were going to deal with all the challenges of the globe weve got to have relationships with everyone,2
Chuck Todd, mr yang well try to squeeze in a couple more things before we go to another break mr yang,2
Andrew Yang, china we need to cooperate with them on climate change ai and other issues north korea,2
Chuck Todd, thanks for the quickness mayor buttigieg,2
Pete Buttigieg, we have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off worse between now and then what we know is that our relationship with the entire world needs to change and it starts by modeling american values at home,2
Chuck Todd, okay mr vice president im trying to be quick,2
Joe Biden, we know nato will fall apart if hes elected four more years its the single most consequential alliance in the history of the united states,2
Chuck Todd, senator sanders,2
Bernie Sanders, its not one country i think it is rebuilding trust in the united nations and understand that we can solve conflicts without war but with diplomacy,2
Chuck Todd, senator harris,2
Kamala Harris, all the members of the nato alliance,2
Chuck Todd, senator gillibrand,2
Kirsten G., president trump is hellbent on starting a war with iran my first act will be to engage iran to stabilize the middle east and make sure we do not start and unwanted neverending war,2
Chuck Todd, senator bennet quickly,2
Michael Bennet, our european allies and every latin american country thats willing to have a conversation about how to deal with the refugee ,2
Chuck Todd, and congressman swalwell,2
Eric Swalwell, our first act in foreign policy were breaking up russia and making up with nato,2
Rachel Maddow, thank you all thank you all,2
Michael Bennet, thats a good plan,2
Rachel Maddow, last question for vice president biden tonight you have made your decades of experience in foreign policy a pillar of your campaign but when the time came to say yes or no on one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the last century you voted for the iraq war you have since said you regret that vote but why should voters trust your judgment when it comes to making a decision about taking the country to war the next time,2
Joe Biden, because once the bush abused that power what happened was we got elected after that i made sure the president turned to me and said joe get our combat troops out of iraq i was responsible for getting 150000 combat troops out of iraq and my son was one of them i also think we should not have combat troops in afghanistan its long overdue it should end and thirdly i believe that youre not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there we cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism so id eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war and not the aumf and make sure that it could only be used for what its intent was and that is to go after terrorists but never do it alone,2
Joe Biden, thats why we have to repair our alliances we put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with isis in iraq and other places thats what i would do thats what i have done and i know how to do it,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders 30 seconds,2
Bernie Sanders, one of the differences  one of the differences that joe and i have in our record is joe voted for that war i helped lead the opposition to that war which is a total disaster second of all i helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the war powers act to get the united states out of the sorely led intervention in yemin which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on earth and thirdly let me be very clear i will do everything i can to prevent a war with iran which would be far worse than disastrous war with iraq,2
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders thank you,2
Joe Biden, you cant go to war without informed consent of the american people,2
Chuck Todd, all right guys we got  good news is you get more time to talk but i have to sneak in one more break,2
Rachel Maddow, well be right back,2
Chuck Todd, well be right back with more debate,2
Chuck Todd, silence,2
Steve Kornacki, well here it is this is the month to start looking at on your calendar february 2020 thats when all the talk ends and the voting begins and that massive gigantic enormous democratic presidential field it gets thinned down and maybe by the end of that month well even have a pretty good sense who the nominees going to be you know iowa always in that leadoff position the iowa caucuses there it is monday february 3rd the race begins in iowa and then traditionally it is an eightday stretch from iowa to new hampshire first caucuses in iowa first primary in new hampshire eight days later so you expect however many candidates are left when they get to the starting line in iowa theres probably going to be far fewer eight later between iowa and new hampshire you can expect a lot of winnowing to take place youll have some clear candidates who are out in front as well,2
Steve Kornacki, the next stop this is a new one on the democratic  a relatively new one only the last couple cycles nevada caucuses in nevada thats the next one and then the big one obviously the south carolina primary the first in the south primary at the end of the month and of course south carolina very important because this is the first date where youre going to have a really substantial black population voting 60 more than 60 of the democratic electorate in the 2016 south carolina primary was african american so a key test there,2
Steve Kornacki, four individual contests well talk only about these states the nights they come in thats going to be february but then flip the calendar from the last day of february look at this go into march just a couple days later super tuesday super tuesday let me give you a sense of what that looks like massive enormous you go from one contest at a time all in the same  you got california you got texas you got a bunch in the south you got massachusetts minnesota all of these states all at once so februarys going to produce some clarity in terms of who is a contender super tuesday mega primary that could give us some real answers potentially in early march,2
Steve Kornacki,  silence,2
Lester Holt, we are back from miami now each candidate will have a final chance to make their case to the voters 45 seconds each we begin with congressman swalwell,2
Eric Swalwell, we cant be a forwardlooking party if we look to the past for our leadership im a congressman but also a father of a twoyear old and an infant when im not changing diapers im changing washington most of the time the diapers smell better i went into congress at 31 and i found a washington that doesnt work for people like you and me its made of the rich and the disconnected i was the first in my family to go to college and have student loan debt so i have led the effort to elect the next generation of members of congress and we have a moment to seize this is a cando generation this is the generation that will end climate chaos this is the generation that will solve student loan debt and this is the generation that will say enough is enough and end gun violence this generation demands bold solutions thats why im running for president,2
Lester Holt, congressman thank you,2
Rachel Maddow, mrs williamson 45 seconds for your closing statements,2
Marianne W., im sorry we havent talked more tonight about how were going to beat donald trump i have an idea about donald trump donald trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk hes not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans hes going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea of what this man has done this man has reached into the psyche of the american people and hes harnessed fear for political purposes so mr president if youre listening i want you to hear me please you have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out so i sir i have a feeling you know what youre doing im going to harness love for political purposes i will meet you on that field and sir love will win,2
Rachel Maddow, mrs williamson thank you,2
Chuck Todd, senator bennet,2
Michael Bennet, thank you thank you my mom and her parents came to the united states to rebuilt their shattered lives in the only country that they could 300 years before that my parents family came searching religious freedom here the ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the united states especially among children living in poverty like the ones i used to work for in the denver public schools thats why im running for president ive had two tough races in colorado but by bringing people people together not by making empty promises and i believe we need to build a broad coalition of americans to beat donald trump end the corruption in washington and build a new era of american democracy and american opportunity,2
Michael Bennet, this is going to be hard to do but its what our parents would have expected its what our kids deserve,2
Chuck Todd, senator,2
Michael Bennet, i hope youll join me in this effort thank you,2
Chuck Todd, thank you governor hickenlooper,2
John H., im a small business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big colorado one of the most progressive states in america we expanded reproductive health to reduce teenage abortion by 64 we were the first state to legalize marijuana and we transformed our justice system in the progress we passed universal background checks in a purple state we got to near universal healthcare coverage we attacked climate change with the toughest method and regulations in the country and for the last three years weve been the number one economy in america,2
John H., you dont need big government to do big things i know that because im the one person up here whos actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about if we turn towards socialism we run the risk of helping to reelect the worst president in american history,2
Chuck Todd, thank you governor,2
Rachel Maddow, senator gillibrand you have the floor for 45 seconds,2
Kirsten G., women in america  women in america are on fire weve marched weve organized weve run for office and weve won but our rights are under attack like never before by president trump and the republicans who want to repeal roe v wade which is why i went to the front lines in georgia to fight for them as president i will take on the fights that no one else will i stood up to the pentagon and repealed dont ask dont tell ive stood up to the banks and voted against the bailout twice ive stood up to trump more than any other senator in the us senate and i have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publiclyfunded elections to deal with political corruption,2
Kirsten G., now is not the time to play it safe now is not the time to be afraid of first we need a president who will take on the big challenges even if she stands alone join me in fighting for this,2
Rachel Maddow, senator gillibrand thank you,2
Lester Holt, mr yang you have 45 seconds for your closing,2
Andrew Yang, first i want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight i am proof that our democracy still works democrats and americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat donald trump in 2020 that is the right question and the right candidate to beat donald trump will be solving the problems that got donald trump elected and will have a vision of a trickleup economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected trump voters conservatives independents and libertarians as well as democrats and progressives i am that candidate i can build a much broader coalition to beat donald trump it is not left it is not right it is forward and that is where ill talk the country in 2020,2
Lester Holt, mr yang thank you,2
Rachel Maddow, senator harris senator harris the floor is yours,2
Kamala Harris, thank you i just want to leave you with a couple of things one we need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of donald trump and i will do that second this election is about you this is about your hopes and your dreams and your fears and what wakes you up at three oclock in the morning thats why i have what i call a 300 am agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month when i think about what our country needs i promise you i will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity with honesty speaking the truth and giving the american family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper,2
Kamala Harris, so i hope to earn your support please join us kamalaharrisorg,2
Rachel Maddow, senator thank you,2
Chuck Todd, mayor buttigieg 45 seconds,2
Pete Buttigieg, nothing about politics is theoretical for me ive had the experience of writing a letter to my family putting it in an envelope marked just in case and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case i didnt come back from afghanistan ive experience with being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the us supreme court i have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below 20000 when i took office into a brighter future im running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go when i get to the current age of the current president in the year 2055 i want to be able to look back on these years and say my generation delivered climate solutions racial equality and an end to endless war help me deliver that new generation to washington before its too late,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator sanders 45 seconds the floor is yours,2
Bernie Sanders, i suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people they have great ideas but how come nothing really change how come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class how come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty how come 45 million people still have student debt how come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of america and here is the answer nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on wall street the insurance industry the pharmaceutical industry the military industrial complex and the fossil fuel industry if we dont have the guts to take them on well continue to have plans well continue to have talk and the rich will get richer and everybody else will be struggling,2
Chuck Todd, thank you senator,2
Rachel Maddow, and lastly well hear from vice president biden sir you have 45 seconds,2
Joe Biden, thank you very much im ready to lead this country because i think its important we restore the soul of this nation this president has ripped it out hes the only president in our history who has equated racist and white supremacist with ordinary and decent people hes the only president who has in fact engaged and embraced dictators and thumbed their nose at our allies im secondly running for president because i think we have to restore the backbone of america the poor and hardworking middle class people you cant do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had,2
Joe Biden, lastly weve got to unite the united states of america as much as anybody says we cant if we do theres not a single thing the american people cant do this is the united states of america we can do anything if were together together so god bless you all and may god protect our troops,2
Rachel Maddow, vice president biden thank you,2
Rachel Maddow, we want to thank our candidates weve had two nights of spirited debate on a range,2
Jake Tapper, welcome back to the cnn democratic presidential debate candidates were about to begin opening statements but first overview of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to ensure a fair debate as moderators we will attempt to guide the discussion,3
Jake Tapper, you will each receive one minute to answer questions 30 seconds for responses in rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification the timing lights will remind you of these limits please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time,3
Jake Tapper, a candidate infringing on another candidates time will have his or her time reduced we also want to ask our audience inside the historic fox theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating the candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another,3
Diana, time now for opening statements youll each receive one minute governor steve bullock please begin,3
Steve Bullock, thanks diana i come from a state where a lot of people voted for donald trump lets not kid ourselves he will be hard to beat yet watching that last debate folks seem more concerned about scoring points or are doing each other with wishlist economics,3
Steve Bullock, then making sure americans know we hear their voices and it will help their lives look im a pro choice pro union populist democrat that won three elections in a red state not by compromising our values but by getting stuff done thats how we win back the places we lost,3
Steve Bullock, showing up listening focusing on the challenges of every day americans that farmers are getting hit right now by trumps trade wars that teacher work in a second job just to afford her insulin they cant wait for revolution their problems are on the here and now,3
Steve Bullock, im a progressive emphasis on progress and im running for president to get stuff done for all of those americans washington has left behind,3
Diana, marianne williamson,3
Marianne W., thank you in 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility it was the idea that people no matter who they were would simply have the possibility of thriving we have not ever totally actualized this ideal but at the times when we have done best we have tried,3
Marianne W., and when forces have opposed them generations of americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces we did that with abolition and with womens suffrage and with civil rights and now it is time a generation of americans to rise up again,3
Marianne W., for an amoral economic system has turned short term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god and this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the wellbeing of we the american people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem we the american people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility say no to what we dont want and yes to what we know can be true,3
Marianne W., im marianne williamson and thats why im running for president,3
Diana, congressman john delaney,3
John Delaney, folks we have a choice we can go down the road that senator sanders and senator warren want to take us with bad policies like medicare for all free everything and impossible promises thatll turn off independent voters and get trump reelected thats what happened with mcgovern thats what happened with mondale,3
John Delaney, thats what happened with dukakis or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal healthcare for every american with choice someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere and then we win the white house im the product of the american dream,3
John Delaney, i believe in it im the grandson of immigrants the son of a construction worker my wife april and i have four amazing daughters i was the youngest ceo in the history of the new york stock exchange created thousands of jobs and then served in congress,3
John Delaney, thats the type of background and my platform is about real solutions not impossible promises that can beat trump and govern thank you,3
Diana, congressman tim ryan,3
Tim Ryan, america is great but not everyone can access americas greatness the systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the american people the economic system that used to create 30 40 50 an hour jobs that you can have a good solid middleclass living now force us to have two or three jobs just to get by,3
Tim Ryan, most families when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills they get a pit in the middle of their stomach we deserve better and the political system is broken too because the entire conversation is about left or right where are you at on the political system and im here to say this isnt about left or right,3
Tim Ryan, this is about new and better and its not about reforming old systems its about building new systems and tonight i will offer solutions that are bold that are realistic and that are a clean break from the past,3
Diana, governor john hickenlooper,3
John H., last year democrats flipped 40 republican seats in the house and not one of those 40 democrats supported the policies of our front runners at center stage now i share their progressive values but im a little more pragmatic i was out of work for two whole years until i started what became the largest brew club in america,3
John H., and i learned the small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor and as governor of colorado created the number one economy in the country we also expanded healthcare reproductive rights we attacked climate change head on we beat the nra we did not build massive government expansions,3
John H., now some will promise that well tonight or a plan for tonight where we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done to provide solutions to problems to make sure that we worked together and created jobs thats how were going to beat donald trump thats how were going to win michigan and the country,3
Diana, senator amy klobuchar,3
Amy Klobuchar, lets get real tonight we debate but ultimately we have to beat donald trump my background its a little different than his i stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man,3
Amy Klobuchar, as the first woman elected to the us senate from the state of minnesota and a candidate for president of the united states thats because we come from a country of shared dreams and i have had it with the racist attacks i have had it with a president that says one thing on tv that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college,3
Amy Klobuchar, youre going to hear a lot of promises up here but im going to tell you this yes i have bold ideas but they are grounded in reality and yes i will make some simple promises i can win this im from the midwest and i have won every race every place every time and i will govern with integrity the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation,3
Diana, congressman beto orourke,3
Beto O’Rourke, im running for president because i believe that america discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need this moment will define us forever and i believe that in this test america will be redeemed in the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone for the rule of law for everyone,3
Beto O’Rourke, and a democracy that serves everyone whatever our differences we know that before we are anything else we are americans first and we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential we will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad,3
Beto O’Rourke, successfully confronting endless war and climate change at this moment of truth let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone by everyone and for everyone,3
Diana, mayor pete buttigieg,3
Pete Buttigieg, im running for president because our country is running out of time it is even bigger than the emergency of the trump presidency ask yourself how somebody like donald trump ever gets within cheating distance as the oval office in the first place it doesnt happen unless america is already in a crisis,3
Pete Buttigieg, an economy thats not working for everyone endless war climate change we have lived this in my industrial midwestern hometown my generation has lived this as long as we have been alive and its only accelerated science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate,3
Pete Buttigieg, by 2030 the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a womans right to choose may not even exist were not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments policies and politicians that have dominated washington for as long as i have been alive,3
Pete Buttigieg, weve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different this is our shot that is why im running for president,3
Diana, senator elizabeth warren,3
Elizabeth W., donald trump disgraces the office of president every single day and anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president i promise no matter who our candidate is i will work my heart out to beat donald trump and to elect a democratic congress but all problems didnt start with donald trump,3
Elizabeth W., donald trump is part of a corrupt rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else were not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness were going to solve them by being the democratic party of big structural change,3
Elizabeth W., we need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone i know whats broken in this country i know how to fix it and i will fight to make it happen,3
Diana, senator bernie sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, tonight in america as we speak 87 million americans are uninsured or underinsured but the healthcare industry made a 100 billion in profits last year tonight as we speak right now 500000 americans are sleeping out on the street and yet companies like amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax,3
Bernie Sanders, tonight half of the american people are living paycheck to paycheck and yet 49 of all new income goes to the top 1 tonight the fossil fuel industry continues to receive 100s of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet,3
Bernie Sanders, we have got to take on trumps racism his sexism xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat trump but to transform our economy and our government,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator sanders lets start the debate with the number one issue for democratic voters healthcare and senator sanders lets start with you you support medicare for all which would eventually take private health insurance away for more than 150 million americans in exchange for government sponsored healthcare for everyone,3
Jake Tapper, congressman delaney just referred to it as bad policy and previously he has called the idea political suicide that will just get president trump reelected what do you say to congressman delaney,3
Bernie Sanders, youre wrong right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system 87 million uninsured or underinsured 500000 americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills 30000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit,3
Bernie Sanders, five minutes away from here john is a country its called canada they guarantee health care to every man woman and child as a human right they spend half of what we spent and by the way when you end up in a hospital in canada you come out with no bill at all healthcare is a human right not a privilege,3
Bernie Sanders, i believe that i will fight for that,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator sanders congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, well im right about this we can create a universal healthcare system to give everyone basic healthcare for free and i have a proposal to do it but we dont have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal,3
John Delaney, my dad the union electrician loved the healthcare he got from the ibew he would never want someone to take that away half of medicare beneficiaries now have medicare advantage which is private insurance or supplemental plans its also bad policy itll underfund the industry,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman,3
John Delaney, many hospitals will close and its bad policy,3
Jake Tapper, senator sanders i want to,3
Elizabeth W., my name was also mentioned in this,3
Jake Tapper, were going to come to you in one second but let me go to senator sanders right now senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, the fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs when their employer changes that insurance if you want stability in the health care system if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to doctor or hospital,3
Bernie Sanders, which is a system which will not bankrupt you the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies,3
Jake Tapper, ,3
Bernie Sanders, and the insurance companies,3
Jake Tapper, thank you sir,3
Bernie Sanders,  ,3
Elizabeth W., ,3
John Delaney, but now hes talking about a different issue what im talking about is really simple we should deal with the tragedy of the uninsured and give everyone healthcare as a right but why do we got to be the party of taking something away from,3
Elizabeth W., no no one is the party,3
Jake Tapper, ,3
John Delaney, thats what theyre running on theyre running on telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal it says it right in the bill we dont have to do that we can give everyone healthcare and allow people to have choice thats the american way,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman senator warren,3
Elizabeth W., so look lets be clear about this we are the democrats we are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone thats what the republicans are trying to do and we should stop using republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care,3
Elizabeth W., now i want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend eddie barkat eddie is 35 years old he has a wife rachel he has a cute little boy named carl he also has als and its killing him and he has health insurance good health insurance,3
Jake Tapper, senator,3
Elizabeth W., and its not nearly enough  important,3
Jake Tapper, senator im staying with you im staying with you but youve exceeded your time and so let me just stay with you on medicare for all,3
Elizabeth W., all right,3
Jake Tapper, at the last debate you said your quote with bernie on medicare for all now senator sanders has said that people in the middle class will pay more in taxes to help pay for medicare for all though that will be offset by the elimination of insurance premiums and other costs,3
Jake Tapper, are you also quote with bernie on medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle class americans to pay for it,3
Elizabeth W., so giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care and id like to finish talking about eddie the guy who has als this isnt funny this is somebody who has health insurance and is dying and every month he has about 9000 in medical bills that his insurance company wont cover,3
Elizabeth W., his wife rachel is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company please cover what the doctors say he needs he talks about what its like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends family and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses,3
Elizabeth W., the basic model of an insurance company has taken as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage that is not working,3
Jake Tapper, thank you,3
Elizabeth W.,  for american across this country,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,3
Elizabeth W., medicare for all will fix that and thats why i will fight for it,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator just a point of clarification in 15 extra seconds would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for medicare for all offset obviously by the elimination of insurance premiums yes or no,3
Elizabeth W., costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations for middle class families cost,3
Elizabeth W., and go up for corporations for middle class families total costs will go down,3
Jake Tapper, governor bullock i want to bring you in you do not support medicare for all how do you respond to senator warren,3
Steve Bullock, no healthcare is so personal to all of us never forget when my 12year old son had a heart attack within 24 hours of his life had to be lifeflighted to salt lake city but because we had good insurance hes here with me tonight at the end of the day im not going to support any plan that rips away quality healthcare from individuals this is an example of wishlist economics it used to be just republicans wanted to repeal and replace now many democrats do as well we can get there with a public option negotiating drug prices ending,3
Jake Tapper, thank you governor bullock i want to bring in mayor buttigieg on the topic of whether or not the middleclass should pay higher taxes in exchange for guaranteed healthcare and the elimination of insurance premiums how do you respond mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg, so we dont have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option or a medicare for all environment will be better than the corporate options we can put it to the test thats the concept of my medicare for all who want to proposal that way if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there well see americans walk away from the corporate options into that medicare option and it will become medicare for all without us having to kick anybody off ,3
Jake Tapper, 15 seconds on the clarification you are willing to raise taxes on middleclass americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums yes or no,3
Pete Buttigieg, i think you can buy into it thats the idea of medicare for all who want it,3
Pete Buttigieg, look this is a distinction without a difference whether youre paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums look in this country if you have health coverage if you dont have health coverage youre paying too much for care and if you do have health coverage youre paying too much for the care ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you mayor buttigieg i want to bring in congressman orourke on the topic of whether the middleclass should pay higher taxes in exchange for universal coverage and the elimination of insurance premiums whats your response,3
Beto O’Rourke, the answer is no the middleclass will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every american is guaranteed worldclass healthcare i think were being offered a false choice some who want to improve the affordable care act at the margins others who want a medicare for all program that will force people off of private insurance i have a better path medicare for america everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in medicare tomorrow those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in medicare and those who have employersponsored insurance ,3
Beto O’Rourke, jake this is important,3
Jake Tapper, whos offering a false choice here,3
Beto O’Rourke, you have some governor bullock who said that we will improve the affordable care act at the margins with a public option you have others to my right who are talking about taking away peoples choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions i was listening to d taylor in nevada his members want to healthcare that they fought for ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman governor bullock he just said youre offering false choice sir,3
Steve Bullock, congressman not at all it took us decades and false starts to get the affordable care act so lets actually build on a public option allowing anyone to buy in we pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world weve got nothing to show for it negotiate prescription drug prices end surprise medical billing thats the way that we can get there without disrupting the lives of 160million people that like their employersponsored health insurance,3
Jake Tapper, congressman orourke you can respond,3
Beto O’Rourke, every estimate that ive seen of expanding aca even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need as the examples that senator warren showed us our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in medicare or can keep their employersponsored insurance,3
Beto O’Rourke, when we listen to the american people and this is what they want us to do they want everyone covered but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman i wanna bring in senator klobuchar senator warren at the beginning of the night said that democrats cannot win the white house with small ideas and spinelessness in the last debate she said the politicians who are not supporting medicare for all simply lack the will to fight for it you do not support medicare for all is senator warren correct do you just not lack the will to fight for it,3
Amy Klobuchar, that is incorrect i just have a better way to do this and in one of my first debates jake i was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent and when she said it i said thank you so this is what i think we need to get done we need the public option thats what barack obama wanted and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone and by the way i just dont buy this ive heard some of these candidates say that its somehow not moral to not have that public option well senator sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was bernie the medicaid public option bill that senator schatz introduced clearly this is the easiest way to move forward quickly and i want to get things done people cant wait ive got my friend nicole out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didnt have the enough money to pay for it and bernie and i have worked on pharmaceutical ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator senator sanders im going to go to senator sanders and then senator warren as you both have mentioned senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, as the author of the medicare bill let me clear up one thing if people talk about how the insurance there are millions of people have insurance they cant go to the doctor and when they come out of the hospital they go bankrupt all right what i am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no copayments and jake your question is a republican talking point at the end of the day and by the way the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator senator warren its your turn,3
Bernie Sanders, oh could i complete that please,3
Jake Tapper, your time was up 30 sends,3
Bernie Sanders, they will be advertising tonight with that talking point,3
Jake Tapper, senator warren,3
Elizabeth W., so we have to think of this in terms of the big frame whats the problem in washington it works great for the wealthy it works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies what its going to take is real courage to fight back against them these insurance companies do not have a god given right to make 23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system they do not have a god given right to put forms in place so that people cannot they want to deny coverage ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator if we could all just stick to the rules of the time that would be great congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, im the only one on the stage who actually has experience in the healthcare business and with all due respect i dont think my colleagues understand the business we have the public option which is great ,3
Bernie Sanders, its not a business,3
John Delaney, the public option is great but it doesnt go far enough it doesnt go far enough im proposing universal healthcare where everyone gets healthcare as a basic human right for free but they have choices my plan better care is fully paid for without raising middleclass tax options so when we think about this debate theres medicare for all which is extreme ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman thank you congressman,3
John Delaney, i was interrupted one more thing,3
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in governor hickenlooper governor hickenlooper id like to hear what you have to say about senator warrens suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of medicare for all lack the political will to fight for it,3
John H., well obviously i disagree with that as much as i respect both of the senators to my right i think it comes down to that question of americans being used to being able to make choices to have the right to make a decision and i think proposing a public option that allows some form of medicare that maybe is a combination of medicare advantage and medicare that people choose it and if enough people choose it it expands the quality improves the cost comes down more people choose it eventually in 15 years you could get there but it would be an evolution not a revolution,3
Jake Tapper, thank you governor senator warren,3
Elizabeth W., we have tried this experiment with the insurance companies and what theyve done is theyve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need why does everybody why does every doctor why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms its because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients thats what we have to fight,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator i want to bring in marianne williamson ms williamson how do you respond to the criticism from senator warren that youre not willing to fight for medicare for all,3
Marianne W., i dont know if senator warren said that about me specifically i admire very much what senator warren has said and what bernie has said but i have to say i have im normally way over there with bernie and elizabeth on this one i hear the others and i have some concern about that as well and i do have concern about what the republicans would say and thats not just a republican talking point i do have concern that it will be difficult i have concerns that it will make it harder to win and i have a concern that it will make it harder to govern because if thats our big fight then the republicans will so shut us down on everything else ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you ms williamson i want to bring in mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg your response,3
Pete Buttigieg, it is time to stop worrying about what the republicans will say look if its true that if we embrace a far left agenda theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists if we embrace a conservative agenda you know what theyre going to do theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists so lets just stand up for the right policy go out there and defend it thats the policy im putting forward not because i think its the right triangulation between republicans here and democrats there because i think its the right answer for people like my motherinlaw who is here whose life was saved by the aca but who was still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her health ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you mayor buttigieg,3
Jake Tapper, senator sanders your response,3
Bernie Sanders, lets be clear what this debate is about nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system what we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent four and a half billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions that is why when i went to canada the other day people paid 110 the price in canada for insulin that theyre paying in the united states,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator i want to bring in congressman tim ryan,3
Jake Tapper, congressman ryan your response,3
Tim Ryan, so here we are in detroit home of the united auto workers we have all our union friends here tonight this plan thats being offered by senator warren and senator sanders will tell those union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that theyre going to lose their healthcare because washingtons going to come in and tell them they got a better plan this is the left and right thing,3
Tim Ryan, new and better is this move medicare down to 50 allow people to buy in kaiser permanente said that if those 60million people do that they will see a 40 reduction in their healthcare cost let businesses buy in jake ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman so senator lets talk about that if medicare for all is enacted there are more than 600000 union members here in michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans now i understand that it would provide universal coverage but can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under medicare for all will be as good as the benefits that their representatives their union reps fought hard to negotiate,3
Bernie Sanders, well two things they will be better because medicare for all is comprehensive it covers all healthcare needs for senior citizens it will finally include dental care hearing aids and eyeglasses ,3
Tim Ryan, but you dont know that,3
Bernie Sanders, second of all,3
Tim Ryan, you dont know that bernie ,3
Jake Tapper, well come to you in a second congressman,3
Bernie Sanders, i do know it i wrote the damn bill and second of all many of our union brothers and sisters nobody more prounion than me up here are now paying high deductibles and copayments and when we do medicare for all instead of having the company putting money into healthcare they can get decent wage increases which theyre not getting today ,3
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in congressman ryan to respond to what senator sanders has said,3
Tim Ryan, i mean senator sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the united states im trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs their wages have been stagnating the world is crumbling around them the only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare and the democratic message is going to be were going to go in and the only thing you have left were going to take it and were going to do better i do not think thats a recipe for success for us its bad policy and its certainly bad politics,3
Jake Tapper, congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, so the bill that senator sanders drafted by definition will lower quality in healthcare because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current medicare rates and the data is clear medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare it covers 80 of the cost of healthcare in this country and private insurance covers 120 so if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers youre going to create a twotier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash and the people who are forced like my dad the union electrician will have that healthcare plan taken away from him they will be forced into and underfunded ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman i want to give senator sanders a chance to respond,3
Bernie Sanders, all right on the medicare for all the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because theyre not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today ,3
John Delaney, ive done the math it doesnt add up,3
Bernie Sanders, second of all maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare but our job is for a nonprofit healthcare system furthermore when we say 500billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every american crazy trying to deal with the health insurance companies hospitals will be better off than they are today ,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator congressman delaney i want to let you have a chance to respond,3
John Delaney, listen his math is wrong thats all im saying that his math is wrong its been welldocumented that if all the bills were paid at medicare rate which is specifically i think its in section 1200 of their bill then many hospitals in this country would close ive been going around rural america and i ask rural hospital administrators one question  if all your bills were paid at the medicare rate last year what would happen and they all look at me and say we would close but the question is why do we have to be so extreme why cant we just give everyone healthcare as a right and allow them to have choice im starting to think this is not about healthcare this is an antiprivate sector strategy ,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman thank you congressman were going to move on were going to move on to the issue of immigration now there is widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants including dreamers but there are some areas of disagreement,3
Dana Bash, mayor buttigieg youre in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the us border illegally why wont that just encourage more illegal immigration,3
Pete Buttigieg, when im president illegally crossing the border will still be illegal we can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law but weve got a crisis on our hands and its not just a crisis of immigration its a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border it is a stain on the united states of america,3
Pete Buttigieg, americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly weve been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime protections for dreamers making sure that that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented cleaning up lawful immigration we know what to do we know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws the problem is we havent had the will to get it done in washington and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement that will end on my wall,3
Dana Bash, just a point of clarification you did raise your hand in the last debate you do want to do criminalize crossing the border ,3
Pete Buttigieg, so in my view if fraud is involved then thats suitable for the criminal statute if not then it should be handled under civil law these show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being ,3
Dana Bash, were not going that here,3
Pete Buttigieg, we appreciate that,3
Steve Bullock, thank you congressman orourke you live near the us mexico border in el paso you disagree with mayor buttigieg on decriminalizing legal border crossings please respond,3
Beto O’Rourke, i do because in my administration after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders more than 9million of our fellow americans freed dreamers from any fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and forprofit detention in this country and then assist those countries in central america so that no family ever has to make that 2000mile journey then i expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman senator warren you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary please respond,3
Elizabeth W., so the problem is that right now the criminalization statute is what gives donald trump the ability to take children away from their parents its what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders we need to continue to have border security and we can do that but what we cant do is not live our values ive been down to the border i have seen the mothers i have seen the cages of babies we must be a country that everyday lives our values and that means we cannot make it a crime when someone comes here ,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren just to clarify thank you senator just to clarify would,3
Elizabeth W.,  cannot make it a crime when someone comes here,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator just to clarify would you decriminalize,3
Elizabeth W., yes,3
Dana Bash,  illegal border crossings,3
Elizabeth W., the point is not about criminalization that has given donald trump the tool to break families apart,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator,3
Elizabeth W., we need,3
Dana Bash, governor hickenlooper your response,3
John H., well i agree that we need secure borders theres no question about that and the frustration with whats going on in washington is theyre kicking the ball back and forth secure the borders make sure whatever law we have doesnt allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages how hard can that be on the two debate nights weve got 170 years of washington experience somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable,3
Elizabeth W., well and one way to fix it is to decriminalize thats the whole point what were looking for here is a way to take away the tools,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren,3
Elizabeth W.,  that donald trump has used to break up families,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren senator klobuchar your response,3
Amy Klobuchar, i would say there is the will to change this in congress whats missing is the right person in the white house i believe that immigrants dont diminish america they are america and if you want to do something about border security you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those northern triangle countries then you pass the bill and what the bill will do is itll greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for help processing the cases and most of all it will allow for a path to citizenship because this is not just about the border,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Amy Klobuchar, donald trump wants to use these people as political pawns,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator klobuchar,3
Amy Klobuchar,  when we have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator sanders you want to provide undocumented immigrants free healthcare and free college why wont this drive even more people to come to the us illegally,3
Bernie Sanders, because well have the strong border protections but the main point i want to make is that what trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people and as president i will end that demonization if a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path in my view they are not criminals they are people fleeing violence,3
Bernie Sanders, and i think the main thing that weve got to do among many others and beto made this point weve got to ask ourselves why are people walking 2000 miles to a strange country where they dont know the language so what we will do the first week we are in the white house is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we rebuild hondouras,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Bernie Sanders,  guatemala and el salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator governor bullock about twothirds of democratic voters and many of your rivals here for the nomination support giving health insurance to undocumented immigrants you havent gone that far why not,3
Steve Bullock, look i think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from peoples lives we got 100000 people showing up at the border right now if we decriminalize entry if we give healthcare to everyone well have multiples of that dont take my word that was president obamas homeland security secretary that said that,3
Steve Bullock, the biggest problem right now that we have with immigration is donald trump hes using immigration to not only rip apart families but rip apart this country we can actually get to the point where we have both safe borders where we have a path to citizenship where we have opportunities for dreamers and you dont have to decriminalize everything what you have to do is have a president in there with the judgment and the decency to treat someone that comes to the border like one of our own,3
Elizabeth W., id just like to add on this,3
Dana Bash, senator he just said your plan is unrealistic how do you respond,3
Elizabeth W., i think that what we have to do is we have to be an america that is clear about what we want to do with immigration we need to expand legal immigration we need to create a path for citizenship not just for dreamers but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas we need to fix the prices at the border,3
Elizabeth W., and a big part of how we do that is we do not play into donald trumps hands he wants to stir up the crisis at the border because thats his overall message its if theres anything wrong in your life blame them,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren governor bullock your response,3
Steve Bullock, but you are playing into donald trumps hands the challenge isnt that its a criminal offense to cross the border the challenge is that donald trump is president and using this to rip families apart a sane immigration system needs a sane leader and we can do that without decriminalizing and providing healthcare for everyone and its not me saying that thats obamas homeland security secretary that said youll cause further problems at the border not making it better,3
Elizabeth W., what youre saying is ignore the law laws matter and it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge who come here seeking asylum that is not a crime and as americans what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border but not criminalize the,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren,3
Elizabeth W.,  activity of a mother fleeing here for safety,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman ryan are senator sanders proposals going to incentivize undocumented immigrants to come into this country illegally,3
Tim Ryan, yes and right now if you want to come into the country you should at least ring the doorbell we have asylum laws i saw the kids up in grand rapids not far from here it is shameful whats happening but donald trump is doing it and even if you decriminalize which we should not do you still have statutory authority the president could still use his authority to separate families so weve got to get rid of donald trump but you dont decriminalize people just walking into the united states,3
Tim Ryan, if theyre seeking asylum of course we want to welcome them were a strong enough country to be able to welcome them and as far as the healthcare goes undocumented people can buy healthcare too i mean everyone else in america is paying for their healthcare i dont think its a stretch for us to ask undocumented people in the country to also pay for healthcare,3
Dana Bash, senator sanders your response,3
Bernie Sanders, well two things a sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform it moves to humane border policy in which by the way we have enough administrative judges so that we dont have incredible backlogs that we have right now,3
Bernie Sanders, but to answer your question i happen to believe that when i talk about healthcare it is a human right that applies to all people in this country and under a medicare for all singlepayer system we could afford to do that,3
Dana Bash, senator sanders thank you ms williamson your response,3
Ms. Williamson, everything that were talking about here tonight is whats wrong with american politics and the democratic party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks not just about symptoms but also about causes when were talking about healthcare we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan we need to realize we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system we need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environmental policies and even our economic policies are leading for people getting sick to begin with,3
Don Lemon, thank you,3
Ms. Williamson, thats what the democratic but i want to say more about immigration,3
Don Lemon, thank you ms williamson,3
Ms. Williamson, okay,3
Don Lemon, thank you ms williamson,3
Ms. Williamson, i hope youll come back to me this time,3
Don Lemon, go ahead thank you ms williamson lets turn now to the issue of gun violence there were three large scale shootings this past weekend in america at a park in brooklyn on the streets of philadelphia and one that left three dead and 12 injured at a food festival in gilroy california mayor buttigieg other than offering words of comfort what are you specifically going to do to stop this epidemic of gun violence,3
Pete Buttigieg, well this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community too far too many times thats the worst part of being mayor getting the phone call consoling grieving parents we have a mass shootings worth of killings everyday in this country,3
Pete Buttigieg, what were doing hasnt worked because we havent had a system in washington capable of delivering what the american people have told us they want 90 of republicans want universal background checks not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons things like what i carried overseas in uniform that have no business in american neighborhoods in peacetime let alone anywhere near a school,3
Pete Buttigieg, i was at an event a few days ago and a 13 year old asked me what we were going to do about school safety and then began shaking and then began crying and we could talk about these policies but we already know the policies the only thing i could think of looking into the eyes of this child is were supposed to be dealing with this so you dont have to high school is hard enough without having to worry about whether youre going to get shot,3
Don Lemon, thank you,3
Pete Buttigieg, and when 90 of americans to happen,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg,  and washington cant deliver,3
Elizabeth W., i disagree,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg,  we cant expect the same,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor,3
Amy Klobuchar, i disagree,3
Don Lemon, governor hickenlooper your response please,3
Amy Klobuchar, i disagree with his diagnosis of the problem,3
Don Lemon, please standby senator please stick to the rules well get to you well come to you in just a minute governor hickenlooper please respond,3
John H., well this is the fundamental nonsense of government another place where despite our best efforts we cant seem to make any progress when i went to the movie theater in aurora in 2012 and saw that footage of what happened in the crime scene ill never forget it and we decided that we were going to go out and take on the nra and we passed as a purple state we passed universal background checks we limited magazine capacity we did the basic work that for whatever reason doesnt seem to be able to get done in washington,3
Don Lemon, thank you governor senator klobuchar please respond,3
Amy Klobuchar, yes this isnt just about a system or its not just about words this is about the nra i sat across from the president of the united states after parkland because ive been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole and i watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks the next day he goes and he meets with the nra and he folds as your president i will not fold i will make sure that we get universal background checks passed the assault weapon ban that we do something about magazines and that we understand when that little six year old boy died steven romero when his dad said hes only six years old,3
Don Lemon, thank you senator,3
Amy Klobuchar, all i can say is hes six years old we have to remember that,3
Don Lemon, mayor buttigieg please respond,3
Pete Buttigieg, this is the exact same conversation weve been having since i was in high school i was a junior when the columbine shooting happened i was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings we have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country we dare not allow there to be a third something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do they wont prevent every incident they wont save every life but we know what to do and it has not happened,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor senator klobuchar please respond,3
Amy Klobuchar, yes what is broken is a political system that allows the nra and other large big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for the people are with us now after parkland those students just didnt march they talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said there must be a better way then we elected people in the house of representatives and guess what it changed and they passed universal background checks and now that bill is sitting on mitch mcconnells doorstep because of the money and the power of the nra as president i will take them on,3
Don Lemon, thank you senator,3
Amy Klobuchar, this is not about systems and words,3
Don Lemon, thank you senator klobuchar governor bullock how can democrats trust you to be the leader on this fight for gun safety when you only changed your position to call for an assault weapons ban last summer,3
Steve Bullock, well like 40 of american households im a gun owner i hunt like far too many people in america ive been personally impacted by gun violence i had an 11 year old nephew jeremy shot and killed on a playground we need to start looking at this as a public health issue not a political issue,3
Steve Bullock, i agree with senator klobuchar it is the nra and its not just gun violence its when we talk about climate when were talking about prescription drug costs washington dc is captured by dark money the coke brothers and others thats been the fight of my career kicking the coke brothers out of montana taking the first case after citizens united up to the supreme court making it so that elections are about people,3
Steve Bullock, thats the way were actually going to make a change on this don is by changing that system and most of the things that people are talking about on this stage were not going to address until we kick dark money and the posters of united corporate spending out of these elections,3
Don Lemon, congressman orourke your response,3
Beto O’Rourke, how else can we explain that we lose nearly 40000 people in this country to gun violence a number that no other country comes even close to that we know what all the solutions are and yet nothing has changed it is because in this country money buys influence access and increasingly outcomes,3
Beto O’Rourke, the centers of disease control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place as president we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of congress or any candidate for federal office we will listen to people not packs people not corporations people not special interests,3
Don Lemon, congressman thank you very much senator sanders you said this in 2013 just months after the sandy hook massacre and i quote here if you pass the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow i dont think it will have a profound affect on the tragedies we have seen do you still agree with that statement today,3
Bernie Sanders, i think we have got to do i think what i meant is what president obama said and that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have the magical solution to the crisis now i come from one of the most rural states in america i have a dminus voting record from the nra and as president i suspect it will be an f record,3
Bernie Sanders, what i believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the nra you asked me about my record back in 1988 coming from a state that had no gun control i called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons i lost that election i will do everything i can not only to take on the nra but to expand in great universal background checks do away with the strong man provision do away with the gun show loophole and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs,3
Don Lemon, mayor buttigieg your response,3
Pete Buttigieg, its still the conversation that weve been having for the last 20 years of course we need to get money of out politics but when i propose the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference end the electoral college amend the constitution if necessary to clear up citizens united have dc actually be a state and depoliticize the supreme court with structural reform people look at me funny as if this country were incapable of structural reform,3
Pete Buttigieg, does anybody really think were going to overtake citizens united without constitutional action this is a country that once changed its constitution so you couldnt drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that,3
Don Lemon, thank you thank you mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg, and youre telling me we cant reform our democracy in our time,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg, we have to or well be having the same argument 20 years from now,3
Don Lemon, please respond governor bullock,3
Steve Bullock, you can make changes even in montana with a twothirds republican legislature we passed a law that said if youre going to spend money in our elections i dont care if you call yourselves americans for america youre going to have to disclose every one of those dollars in the last 90 days ill never forget running for reelection in 2016 even we stopped the coke brothers from spending it that time if we can kicked the coke brothers out of montana we can do it in dc we can do it everywhere and were also taking steps additional steps that weve taken i passed an executive order,3
Don Lemon, thank you,3
Steve Bullock, even if youre in a contract with the state you have to disclose,3
Don Lemon, governor bullock thank you very much,3
Elizabeth W., id like to have a chance on this,3
Don Lemon, ms williamson how do you respond on this issue of gun safety,3
Ms. Williamson, the issue of gun safety of course is that the nra has us in a choke hold but so do the pharmaceutical companies so do the health insurance companies so do the fossil fuel companies and so do the defense contractors and none of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns,3
Ms. Williamson, but for politicians including my fellow candidates who themselves have taken tens of thousands in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars from these same corporate donors to think that they now have the moral authority to say were going to take them on i dont think the democratic party should be surprised that so many americans believe yada yada yada it is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of these corporations and can say with real moral authority that is over we are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns thats what we need to stand up to we need to have a constitutional amendment we need to have legislation to do it,3
Don Lemon, thank you,3
Ms. Williamson, and until we do it its just the same old,3
Don Lemon, thank you ms williamson the debate will be right back right after this short break,3
Elizabeth W., id like to be heard in this,3
Jake Tapper, presidential debate we are live from detroit michigan in poll after poll democratic voters say that they want a candidate who can beat president trump more than they want a candidate who agrees with them on major issues governor hickenlooper you ran a facebook ad that warned quote socialism is not the answer the ad also said quote dont let extremes give trump four more years are you saying that senator sanders is too extreme to beat president trump,3
John H, im saying the policies of this notion that youre going to take private insurance away from 180 million americans who many of them dont want to give it many of them do want to get rid of it but some dont many dont or youre going to the green new deal make sure that every americans guaranteed a government job that they want that is a disaster at the ballot box you might as well fedex the election of donald trump,3
John H, i think weve got to focus on where donald trump is failing the word malpractice and this is interesting i always thought it was doctors or lawyers its negligent improper illegal professional activity for doctors lawyers or public officials google it check it out donald trump is malpractice personified weve got to point that out why is it soybean farmers in iowa did 10 good years to get back to where they were two years ago wheres the small manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back why are we lurching from one international crisis to another all things that he promised american voters weve got to focus on that and the economy and jobs and training so that we can promise a future for america that everybody wants to invest in,3
Jake Tapper, thank you governor senator sanders you are a proud democratic socialist how do you respond to governor hickenlooper,3
Bernie Sanders, well the truth is that every credible poll that i have seen has me beating donald trump including the battleground states of michigan where i won the democratic primary wisconsin where i won the democratic primary and pennsylvania and the reason we are going to defeat trump and beat him badly is that he is a fraud and a phony and were going to expose him for what he is,3
Bernie Sanders, the american people want to have a minimum wage which is a living wage 15 bucks an hour ive helped lead that effort the american people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs not the highest prices in the world ive helped lead the effort for that as well,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator governor hickenlooper i want to bring you back to respond,3
John H, so again i think if were going to force americans to make these radical changes theyre not going to go along throw your hands up but you havent,3
Bernie Sanders, okay,3
John H, oh i can do it but you havent implemented the plans us governors and mayors are the ones that we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the governments supposed to take over all these responsibilities and theres no preparation the details dont work you cant just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed,3
Bernie Sanders, john,3
Jake Tapper, senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, john i was a mayor and i helped transform my city i have some practical experience second of all interestingly enough today is the anniversary of medicare 54 years ago under lyndon johnson and a democratic congress they started a new program after one year it had 19 million elderly people in it please dont tell me that in a four year period we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35 this is not radical this is what virtually every other country on earth does,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,3
Bernie Sanders, we are the odd guy out,3
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in congressman ryan youre from the state of ohio its a state that voted twice for obama and then went to president trump in 2016 please respond to senator sanders,3
Tim Ryan, i would just say hillary clinton was winning in the polls too to take a snapshot in the polls today and apply it 16 months from now or whenever it is i dont think is accurate now in this discussion already tonight weve talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial midwest weve talked about decriminalizing the border and weve talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare,3
Tim Ryan, i quite frankly dont think that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win weve got to talk about the working class issues the people that take a shower after work who havent had a raise in 30 years if we focus on them well win the election,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressman i want to bring in congressman orourke your response sir,3
Beto O’Rourke, bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete theres a new battleground state texas and it has 38 electoral college votes and the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties no matter how red or rural we did not write you off no matter how blue or urban we did not take you for granted and we didnt trim our sales either we had the courage of our convictions talking about universal healthcare comprehensive immigration reform and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late we brought everyone in and now we have a chance to beat donald trump in texas,3
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you congressman i want to bring governor bullock were talking about whether democrats are moving too far to the left to win the white house president trump won your home state of montana by 20 points how do you respond sir,3
Steve Bullock, yes the only one of the field of 37 that actually won a trump state 25 to 30 of my voters voted for donald trump i know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those trump voters back if were ever going to win but this isnt just a choice between the left and the center its not a choice just between sort of these wishlist economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win,3
Steve Bullock, what folks want is a fair shot the way i won the way we can win is actually focusing on the economy and democracy not working for most people thats how i win thats how we can take back the office,3
Jake Tapper, thank you governor senator warren you make it a point to say that youre a capitalist is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than senator sanders,3
Elizabeth W, well it is my way of talking about i know how to fight and i know how to win i took on giant banks and i beat them i took on wall street and ceos and their lobbyists and their lawyers and i beat them i took on a popular republican incumbent senator and i beat him i remember when people said barack obama couldnt get elected shoot i remember when people said donald trump couldnt get elected but heres where we are i get it there is a lot at stake and people are scared but we cant choose a candidate we dont believe in just because were too scared to do anything else and we cant ask other people to vote for a candidate we dont believe in democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it i am not afraid and for democrats to win you cant be afraid either,3
Jake Tapper, congressman delaney your response,3
John Delaney, so i think democrats win when we run on real solutions not impossible promises when we run on things that are workable not fairytale economics look at this story of detroit this amazing city that were in this city is turning around because the government and the private sector or working well together that has to be our model going forward we need to encourage collaboration between the government the private sector and the nonprofit sector and focus on those kitchen table pocketbook issues that matter to hardworking americans building infrastructure creating jobs improving their pay,3
Jake Tapper, thank you congressmen,3
John Delaney, creating universal healthcare and lowering drug prices we can do it,3
Jake Tapper, senator warren,3
Elizabeth W, i dont understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the united states just to talk about what we really cant do and shouldnt fight for i dont get it our biggest problem in washington is corruption it is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat and we need to have the courage to fight back against that and until were ready to do that its just more of the same well im ready to get in this fight im ready to win this fight,3
John H, thank you senator congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, when we created social security we didnt say pensions were illegal we can have big ideas to transform the lives i mean i started two companies and took them public before i was 40 im as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone but i also believe we need to have solutions that are workable can you imagine if we tried to start social security now but said private pensions are illegal thats the equivalent of what senator sanders and senator warren are proposing with healthcare thats not a big idea thats an idea thats dead on arrival that will never happen so why dont we actually talk about things big ideas that we can get done the stakes are too high,3
John H, thank you congressman senator warren,3
John Delaney, so look he talks,3
Bernie Sanders, he just mentioned plans,3
Jake Tapper, well come to you right after that senator warren,3
Elizabeth W, he talks about solutions that are workable we have tried the solution of medicare medicaid and private insurance and what have the private insurance companies done theyve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system theyve made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms why not because theyre trying to track your healthcare they just want one more excuse to say no insurance companies do not have a god given right to suck money out of our health care system and 2020 is our chance to stop that,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, detroit was mentioned and im delighted detroit is rebounding let us understand detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the street as they moved to low wage countries to win this election and to defeat donald trump which by the way in my view is not going to be easy we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision we need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,3
Bernie Sanders, by among other things making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator thank you senator i want to bring him senator klobuchar at the beginning of the night you said youre going to hear a lot of promises on the stage and previously you have said when asked about your primary opponents quote a lot of people are making promises and im not going to make promises just to get elected who on this stage is making promises just to get elected,3
Amy Klobuchar, everyone wants to get elected but my point is this i think when we have a guy in the white house that has now told over 10000 lies that we better be very straight forward with the american people and no do i think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of america off of their current insurance in four years no i dont think were going to do that i think there is a better way to get what we all want to see which is lower costs for healthcare,3
Amy Klobuchar, do i think that were going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids no i dont think were going to do that so thats what im talking about but what i dont like about this argument right now what i dont like about it at all is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election and i think how we win in an election is to bring everyone with us and yes i have one in a state every single time statewide i have won those congressional districts that donald trump won by over 20 points he just targeted minnesota last week and ive done it by getting out there and talking to people by knowing rural issues and farm issues,3
Jake Tapper, thank you senator klobuchar,3
Amy Klobuchar, and bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country thats what we want,3
Jake Tapper, i want to bring congressman orourke congressman orourke please respond,3
Beto O’Rourke, i think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the american people is delivering on our commitments as a member of congress when i learned that the el paso va had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied and was related to the suicide epidemic we made it our priority and we turned around the va in el paso we took that lesson nationally and i worked with republican and democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom i agree on almost nothing donald trump to show that at the end of the day we will put the american people first before party before any other concern,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman orourke weve been asking voters to weigh in on what theyd most like to hear democrats debate among the topics they told us theyre most interested in the climate crisis congressman delaney ill start with you you say the green new deal is about as realistic as trump saying mexico was going to pay for the wall but scientists say we need essentially to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050 to avoid the most catastrophic consequences why isnt this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis,3
Dana Bash,  why isnt this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic,3
John Delaney, well first of all because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate like universal healthcare guaranteed government jobs and universal basic income so that only makes it harder to do,3
John Delaney, my plan which gets us to net zero by 2050 which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids will get us there i put a price on carbon take all the money give it back to the american people in a dividend that was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis its the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the congress im going to increase the department of energy research budget by fivefold because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem im going to create a market for something called direct air capture which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because i dont think well get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things im going to increase investment in renewables and im going to create something called the climate corp that is a plan thats realistic its a bet on the us private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
John Delaney,  net zero by 2050 for our kids,3
Dana Bash, thank you thank you congressman senator warren youre a cosponsor of the green new deal your response to congressman delaney,3
Elizabeth W, so climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world it puts every living thing on this planet at risk i have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best and that is innovate and create so ive proposed putting 2 trillion in so we do the research we then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in america that will produce about 12 million manufacturing jobs right here in michigan right here in ohio right here in the industrial midwest,3
Elizabeth W, and the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world right now for every 1 the united states,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Elizabeth W,  spends trying to market around the world,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren,3
Elizabeth W,  chinas spending 100,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren governor hickenlooper you take issue with the green new deal please respond,3
John H, well i think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem its a distraction i share the urgency of every one up here we have to recognize i mean everyones got good ideas what we do in this country is no better than just a best practice right its what we do here is a best practice at a template but its got to be done all over the world so weve got to be building bridges right now with people like china who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property we need to work on that but not with the tariff system we need every country working together if were going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren your response,3
Elizabeth W, look i put a real policy on the table to create 12 million new jobs in green manufacturing theres going to be up 23 trillion worldwide market for this this could revitalize huge cities across this country and no one wants to talk about what you want to do instead is find the republican talking point of a madeup piece of some other part and say oh we dont really have to do anything thats the problem weve got in washington right now it continues,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Elizabeth W,  to be a washington that works great for oil companies just not for people worried about climate change,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator warren congressman ryan,3
Tim Ryan, yeah,3
Dana Bash, we are here in michigan where there are about 180000 workers in auto manufacturing your state of ohio has around 96000 workers in that industry senator sanders is cosponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas power car sales by 2040 given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state how concerned are you about senator sanders plan,3
Tim Ryan, well if we get our act together we wont have to worry about it my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the united states again that would pull the government the department of energy department of transportation work with the private sector work with investors emerging tech companies to dominate the electric vehicle market china dominates it now 50 to 60 i want us to dominate the battery market and make those here in the united states and cut the workers in on the deal the charging stations solar panels same thing china dominates 60 of the solar panel market,3
Tim Ryan, so this person will work in the white house report directly to me and were going to start making things again but you cannot get there on climate unless we talk about agriculture we need to convert our industrial agriculture system over to a sustainable and regenerative agriculture system,3
Female, i agree,3
Tim Ryan,  that actually sequesters carbon into the soil and you can go ask gabe brown and allen williams who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture so we can move away from all the subsidies that were giving to farmers they havent made a profit in five years and we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities thats going to drive healthcare down thats another part of the healthcare conversation,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Tim Ryan,  that we didnt even have how do we start,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman ryan,3
Tim Ryan,  talking about health instead of just disease care,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator sanders your response,3
Bernie Sanders, i get a little bit tired of democrats afraid of big ideas republicans are not afraid of big ideas they could give 1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations they could bail out the crooks on wall street so please dont tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry and nothing happens unless we do that,3
Bernie Sanders, here is the bottom line we got to ask ourselves a simple question what do you do with an industry that knowingly for billions of dollars in shortterm profits is destroying this planet i say that its criminal activity,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Bernie Sanders,  that cannot be allowed to continue,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator sanders congressman your response,3
Tim Ryan, well yeah i would just say  i didnt say we couldnt get there until 2040 bernie you dont have to yell i mean all im saying is all im saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing and if were waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles were screwed so we better get busy now and thats why im saying get a chief manufacturing officer align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward and then heres what ill do as president,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman,3
Tim Ryan, cut the worker in on the deal make sure these are union jobs and i will double union membership to make sure that these new jobs pay what the old fossil fuel jobs pay,3
Dana Bash, senator sanders your response,3
Bernie Sanders, look on this issue my friends there is no choice we have got to be super aggressive if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable so i dont disagree with tim what that means is we got to a take on the fossil fuel industry b it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and a hell of a lot of good union jobs as we do that weve got to transform our transportation system,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator,3
Bernie Sanders, and we have to lead the world,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders,  because this is not just an american issue,3
Dana Bash, governor bullock your response,3
Steve Bullock, all of us agree that we have to address climate change no one on this stage is talking about though the republicans wont even acknowledge that climate change is real dana and thats because of the corrupting influence of money that has been the fight of my career,3
Steve Bullock, and second of which as we transition to this clean energy economy youve got to recognize there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country and far too often democrats sound like theyre part of the problem we got to make sure to aid in those transitions as we get to a carbon neutral world which i think we can do by 2040,3
Dana Bash, thank you governor just to clarify who is part of the problem,3
Steve Bullock, who oh no i think democrats often when theyre saying oh these fossil fuel industries these workers those coal miner workers look the worlds changing we got to make it change but i think democrats often sound like the people that as congressman ryan would say shower at the end of the day that theyre part of the problem and far too many communities are being left behind as we make this transition,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Steve Bullock, look were having this discussion and we can talk about competing plans,3
Dana Bash, thank you governor i want to get senator sanders a chance to respond,3
Bernie Sanders, look steve aint nobody in the congress whos more strongly pro worker than i am so when i talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry what i am also talking about is a just transition all right we can create and what the green new deal is about its a bold idea we can create millions of good paying jobs we can rebuild communities in rural america that have been devastated so we are not antiworker we are going to provide make sure that those workers have a transition new jobs healthcare and education,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator,3
Steve Bullock, and look,3
Dana Bash, governor bullock your response,3
Steve Bullock, and look bernie i was a unionside labor lawyer i fought day after day and i know but we set this up as a false choice far too often are we going to actually address climate change fire seasons are 80 days longer in the west now or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life you can do both,3
Bernie Sanders, yes,3
Steve Bullock, but lets actually have the scientists drive this lets not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we cant even get a republican,3
Dana Bash, thank you governor bullock,3
Steve Bullock,  to acknowledge that the climates changing,3
Dana Bash, congressman orourke your response,3
Beto O’Rourke, ive listened to scientists on this and theyre very clear we dont have more than 10 years to get this right and we wont meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country weve got to bring everyone in the people of detroit and those that i listened to in flint last week they want the challenge they want those jobs they want to create the future for this country and the world those community college students that i met in tucumcari new mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country and those farmers in iowa say pay me for the environmental services the planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements thats how we meet the challenge we do it with everyone in this country we bring everyone into the solution,3
Dana Bash, thank you congressman mayor buttigieg your response,3
Pete Buttigieg, we have all put out highly similar visions on climate it is all theoretical we will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency if and only if we beat donald trump nominate me and you get to see the president of the united states stand next to an american war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve nominate me and we will have a different conversation with american voters about why the president of the united states thinks youre a sucker when the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Pete Buttigieg,  or the cost of prescription drugs and he has done nothing about it except a tax cut for the corporations,3
Dana Bash, thank you mayor buttigieg senator klobuchar i want to ask you about something that cnn heard from a michigan democratic primary voter weve been reaching out and getting their questions kimber from birmingham michigan has this question what is your plan to address infrastructure including the water issue so another flint michigan does not happen again,3
Amy Klobuchar, thank you dana and i was just in flint and they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous so my plan and i am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and i did that because this is a bread and butter issue its a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams i think the governor here in michigan smartly ran on the slogan fix the damn roads and it is an issue for union jobs,3
Amy Klobuchar, and so i think what we need to do is not have a president thats promised he was going to do that on election night if anyone remembers and then he hasnt followed through he has done nothing he blew up a meeting at the white house,3
Amy Klobuchar, i would put 1 trillion into this and i would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his maralago friends richer as he promised and i would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you wont have what you just saw in detroit with the jefferson chalmers neighborhood the african neighborhood that was africanamerican neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms,3
Amy Klobuchar, and i truly believe that if were going to move on infrastructure,3
Dana Bash, thank you,3
Amy Klobuchar,  and climate change you need a,3
Male, dana,3
Amy Klobuchar,  voice from the heartland,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator klobuchar ms,3
Amy Klobuchar, that you need a voice from the heartland,3
Dana Bash, thank you senator klobuchar ms williamson whats your response on the flint water crisis,3
Ms. Williamson, my response on the flint water crisis is that flint is just the tip of the iceberg i was recently in denmark south carolina where it is there is a lot of talk about it being the next flint we have an administration that has gutted the clean water act we have communities particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice i assure you i lived in grosse pointe what happened in flint would not have happened in grosse pointe this is part of the dark underbelly of american society the racism the bigotry and the entire conversation that were having here tonight if you think any of this wonkiness is is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country then im afraid that the democrats are going to see some very dark days we need to say it like it is its bigger than flint its all over this country its particularly people of color its particularly people who do not have the money to fight back and if the democrats dont start saying it then why would those people feel that theyre there for us and if those people dont feel it they wont vote for us and donald trump will win,3
Don Lemon, thank you very much ms williamson,3
Ms. Williamson, thank you,3
Don Lemon, we want to turn now to the issue of race in america congressman orourke president trump is pursuing a reelection strategy based in part on racial division how do you convince primary voters that youd be the best nominee to take on president trump and heal the racial divide in america,3
Beto O’Rourke, well call his racism out for what it is and also talk about its consequences it doesnt just offend our sensibilities to hear him say send her back about a member of congress because shes a woman of color because shes a muslim american it doesnt just offend our sensibilities when he calls mexican immigrants rapists and criminals or seeks to ban all muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over from every tradition of faith it is also changing this country hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years on the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban muslim travel the mosque in victoria texas was burned to the ground so we must not only stand up against donald trump and defeat him in this next election but we must also ensure that we dont just tolerate or respect our differences but we embrace them thats what weve learned in el paso texas my hometown one of the safest cities in the united states of america not despite but because its a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees we will show that our diversity,3
Don Lemon, thank you,3
Beto O’Rourke,  is our strength in my administration,3
Don Lemon, congressman orourke thank you very much governor hickenlooper why are you the best nominee to heal the racial divide in america please respond,3
John H, well the core value behind this entire countrys history is working towards a more perfect union that all people are created equal and we fall and fall away from that i think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools in colorado when i was mayor we got to universal prek for every kid in the urban city we did major police reform 10 years before ferguson why is it now that five years after ferguson we still dont have anything how do we get affordable housing we created a scholarship fund for every kid youve got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country,3
Don Lemon, thank you governor,3
Elizabeth W, wait,3
Don Lemon, senator warren im coming to you now last week the fbi director christopher wray said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year had been motivated by white supremacy in fact the alleged shooter in this weekends attack in gilroy california referenced a wellknown white supremacist book on social media how are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy,3
Elizabeth W, we need to call out white supremacy for what it is domestic terrorism and it poses a threat to the united states of america we live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism economic racism criminal justice racism health care racism the way we do better is to fight back and show something better so i have a plan for example on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids but weve got to acknowledge whats happened on race so my plan has universal tuitionfree college for all of our kids but also increases the pell grants and levels the playing field by putting 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities it cancels student loan debt for 95 of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the blackwhite wealth gap in america,3
Don Lemon, thank you senator very much mayor buttigieg you have been criticized for your handling of racial issues in your home city of south bend from diversity in the police force to housing policy given your record how can you convince africanamericans that you should be the democratic nominee,3
Mayor Buttigieg, as an urban mayor serving a diverse community the racial divide lives within me im not saying that i became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch but in our city we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested africanamerican neighborhood right now in the wake of a policeinvolved shooting our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the useofforce policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters i proposed a douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action systemic racism has touched every part of american life from housing to health to home ownership if you walk into an emergency room and you are black your reports of pain will be taken less seriously if you apply for a job and you are black you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume its why ive proposed that we do everything from investing in historicallyredlined neighborhoods,3
Don Lemon, mayor,3
Mayor Buttigieg,  to build black wealth in home ownership,3
Don Lemon, thank you mayor,3
Mayor Buttigieg, to supporting entrepreneurship for black americans,3
Don Lemon, thank you very much senator klobuchar what do you say to those trump voters who prioritize the economy over the presidents bigotry,3
Amy Klobuchar, well first of all there are people that voted for donald trump before that arent racist they just wanted a better shake in the economy and so i would appeal to them but i dont think anyone can justify what this president is doing little kids literally woke up this weekend turned on the tv and saw their president calling their city the town of baltimore nothing more than a home for rats and i can tell you as your president that will stop the second thing i would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country i know that because i have lived it and that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure theres a decent retirement system in place yes we help the africanamerican community and we must because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what weve seen in the last decades but we help everyone so what i say to the people in my rural parts of my state just like i say to them in the city and bring them together is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone,3
Ms. Williamson, senator klobuchar thank you very much congressman orourke please respond,3
Beto O’Rourke, i want to acknowledge something that were all touching on which is the very foundation of this country the wealth that we have built the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force the legacy of slavery and segregation and jim crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country today as president i will sign into law and new voting rights act i will focus on education address healthcare disparities but i will also sign into law sheila jackson lees reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation weve waited too long in this country to have,3
Don Lemon, thank you congressman orourke speaking of reparations ms williamson many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery but you are calling for up to 500 billion dollars in financial assistance what makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations,3
Ms. Williamson, well first of all its not 500 billion dollars in financial assistance its 500 billion dollar 200 to 500 billion dollars payment of a debt that is owed that is what reparations is we need some deep truthtelling when it comes we dont need another commission to look at evidence i appreciate what congressman orourke has said it is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal all that a country is as a collection of people people heal when there is some deep truthtelling we need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in america it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with that great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism,3
Ms. Williamson, what makes me qualified to say 200 to 500 billion dollars ill tell you what makes me qualified if you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war four to five and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four if you did the math today it would be trillions of dollars and i believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult and i believe that 200 to 500 billion is politically feasible today because so many americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface and emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal,3
Don Lemon, ms williamson thank you very much senator sanders senator sanders you dont think cash payments are the best way to address this issue but according to a new gallup poll 73 of africanamericans are in favor of cash payments to black americans who are descendants of slaves how do you respond to them,3
Bernie Sanders, well i respond to that by saying that i am supportive of jim clyburns legislation which is called 102030 and what that understands is that as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare in education in financial services we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in america including africanamerican communities in terms of education i also have a plan its called the thurgood marshall plan and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in america it would triple funding for title i schools it would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least 60000 a year,3
Don Lemon, senator sanders thank you very much the debate continues right after this short break,3
Don Lemon, welcome back to the cnn democratic presidential debate live from detroit lets turn now to the economy congressman ryan president trumps tariffs have boosted the us steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in michigan which could drive up the cost of cars as president would you continue president trumps steel tariffs,3
Tim Ryan, look i think president trump was onto something when he talked about china china has been abusing the economic system for a long time they steal intellectual property they subsidize goods coming into this country theyve displaced steel workers auto workers across the board eroded our manufacturing,3
Tim Ryan, we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top 1 or to china for them to build their military so i think we need some targeted response against china but you know how you beat china you outcompete them and thats why id put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base weve got to fill these factories in detroit in youngstown that used to make cars and steel weve got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles batteries charging stations make sure theyre making solar panels,3
Tim Ryan, as i said earlier china dominates 60 of the solar panel market they dominate 5060 of the electric vehicle market were going to make 10 million electric vehicles somewhere in the world in the next 10 years i want them made in the united states thats why i have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the,3
Speaker 1, congressman,3
Tim Ryan,  white house and help drive this agenda,3
Speaker 1, thank you just as a point of clarification as president would you continue president trumps steel tariffs yes or no,3
Tim Ryan, well i would have to reevaluate i think some of them are effective but hes bungled the whole thing obviously see heres the problem with president trump one of many he has a tactical move whats the grand strategy for the united states china has a 100year plan a 50year plan a 30year plan a 20year plan we live in a 24hour news cycle that spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics,3
Speaker 1, thank you congressman congressman delaney your response,3
John Delaney, so listen this is what i dont understand president trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on president obama,3
John Delaney, im the only one running for president who actually supports the transpacific partnership president obama was right about that we should be getting back in that senator warren just issued a trade plan  that would prevent the united states from trading with its allies we cant go and we cant isolate ourselves from the world we have to engage with fair rulesbased trade,3
Speaker 1, thank you congressman delaney senator warren please respond,3
Elizabeth Warre, for decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multinational corporations to help giant multinational corporations they have no loyalty to america they have no patriotism if they can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico theyll do it in a heartbeat if they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to vietnam theyll do it in a heartbeat,3
Elizabeth Warre, i have put out a new comprehensive plan that says were not going to do it that way were going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table with small businesses at the table with small farmers at the table with environmentalists at the table with human rights activists at the table and then were going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to americas markets they want to sell to you,3
John Delaney, that was the tpp,3
Elizabeth Warre, ill finish,3
Speaker 1, congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, sorry,3
Speaker 1, thank you senator,3
Elizabeth Warre, is everyone wants to get to american markets,3
Speaker 1, thank you senator,3
Elizabeth Warre, no so the question is,3
Speaker 1, senator thank you please abide by the rules,3
Elizabeth Warre, we need to raise our standards,3
Speaker 1, congressman delaney its your turn thank you senator congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, so that was the transpacific partnership i think president obama was right he did include environmental standards he did include labor standards we would be in an entirely different position with china if we had entered the transpacific partnership,3
John Delaney, we cant isolate ourselves from the world we cant isolate ourselves from asia senator warrens plan basically that she put out we would not be able to trade with the united kingdom,3
Elizabeth Warre, no what this is about,3
John Delaney, we would not be able to trade with the eu it is so extreme that itll isolate,3
Speaker 1, thank you congressman delaney,3
John Delaney,  the american,3
Speaker 1, congressman delaney,3
John Delaney,  economy from the rest of the world,3
Speaker 1, senator,3
Bernie Sanders, ,3
Speaker 1, senator warren,3
Bernie Sanders, ,3
Elizabeth Warre,  i think he said warren,3
Speaker 1, senator sanders please let senator warren respond,3
Bernie Sanders, oh im sorry,3
Elizabeth Warre, what the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by american workers for american workers american workers want those jobs and we can build the trade deals that do it people want access to our markets all around the world then the answer is lets make them raise their standards make them pay their workers more let their workers unionize raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products,3
Elizabeth Warre, right now the whole game is working for the big multinationals its just not working for the people here in the united states and we can change that,3
Speaker 1, senator thank you very much congressman orourke your response,3
Beto O’Rourke, the question was about tariffs and theyre a huge mistake they constitute the largest tax increase on the american consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard and farmers in iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences,3
Beto O’Rourke, when have we ever gone to war including a trade war without allies and friends and partners as president we will hold china accountable but we will bring our allies and friends like the european union to bear and well also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and american workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor not just here in the united states,3
Speaker 1, congressman orourke,3
Beto O’Rourke,  but in the ,3
Speaker 1, senator sanders  please respond to congressman orourke,3
Bernie Sanders, yeah okay youre looking i believe at that the only member of congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements nafta pntr with china which costs us over four million jobs but also helped lead the effort against these agreements,3
Bernie Sanders, now elizabeth is absolutely right if anybody here thinks that corporate america gives one damn about the average american worker youre mistaken if they can save five cents by going to china mexico or vietnam or any place else thats exactly what they will do,3
Bernie Sanders, as president let me tell you what i will do these guys line up at the federal troughs they want military contracts they want all kinds of contracts well under my administration you aint going to get those contracts if you throw american workers out on the street,3
Speaker 1, senator sanders thank you very much governor hickenlooper your response,3
John Hickenloop, so i think again i think congressman delaney has got a point here and there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic the bottom line is you talk to any economist there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner trade wars are for losers and the bottom line is weve got to recognize lets negotiate a better trade deal but youre not going to win against china in a trade war when theyve got 25 of our total debt,3
John Hickenloop, and step back and look heres trump gives that giant tax cut and at the same time so were paying in tariffs about oh 8001200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich essentially whats happening is now hes transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class thats whats outrageous but tariffs are not the solution,3
Speaker 1, governor thank you senator warren,3
Elizabeth Warre, anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just dont understand whats going on look at the new nafta 20 whats the central feature its to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge canadians americans and mexicans more money and make more profits thats what trade deals have,3
Pete Buttigieg,  rid of loans,3
Speaker 9, thank you mayor buttigieg senator sanders you want to forgive all student loan debt,3
Bernie Sanders, as a matter of fact i do but before i get into that the major issue that we dont talk about in congress you dont talk about in the media is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in america you got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 you got 1 that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 49 of all new income goes to the top 1,3
Bernie Sanders, companies like amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax and weve got 500000 people sleeping out on the street what we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate america that they are americans theyll participate in our society but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes period,3
Speaker 9, thank you senator sanders ms williamson,3
Elizabeth Warre, id like to respond,3
Speaker 9,  you are proposing to make college free for all qualified students should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college,3
Marianne Willia, i think that all domestic and international policies should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy thats how you stimulate your economy so if a few people take advantage but there are four or five people who are going to take the money that they then have in the bank,3
Marianne Willia, when you look at this 15 trillion college debt this is why i agree with bernie or i would be the okay why dont we swap it we had a 2 trillion tax cut where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very very richest among us that does not stimulate the economy,3
Marianne Willia, if we get rid of this college debt think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending theyll be able to start their business the best thing you could do to stimulate the us economy is to get rid of this debt this is not just about a plan to do it its about a philosophy of governing,3
Marianne Willia, and ive heard some people hear tonight i almost wonder why youre democrats you seem to think theres something wrong about using the instruments of government to help people that is what government should do all policy should help people thrive that is how we will have peace and that is how we will help ,3
Speaker 9, thank you thank you ms williamson congressmen orourke you dont support free fouryear college your response to ms williamson,3
Beto O’Rourke, i support free twoyear college earn that associates degree realize your full potential debtfree fouryear college but unlike some of the other candidates on the stage thats not just for tuition that is room and books and board the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country,3
Beto O’Rourke, and then for that school teacher who in many places like texas is working a second or a third job full forgiveness for outstanding student loan debt forgiveness for that person willing to work at the va and serve our former service members and we do not do that at the expense of unions we elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life,3
Speaker 9, thank you thank you congressman senator klobuchar your response,3
Amy Klobuchar, i want to make it easier for kids to go to college and i think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most and my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids for wall street kids to go to college theres no difference it says everyone is free i dont think that makes sense and i am very concerned if we do things like that the debt were going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation,3
Amy Klobuchar, so what i would do about student loan debt is that i would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and i would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally over five 10 years can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we dont have enough workers i think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator,3
Amy Klobuchar,  with our education policy,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator i want to turn to foreign policy now senator sanders president trump has argued that the united states cannot continue to be the policeman of the world you said the exact same thing on a debate stage in 2016 if voters are hearing the same message from you and president trump on the issue of military intervention how should they expect that you will be any different from him,3
Bernie Sanders, trump is a pathological liar i tell the truth we have been in afghanistan i think 18 years in iraq 16 or 17 years we have spent 5 trillion on the war on terror and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began,3
Bernie Sanders, were going to spend the congress passed and i will not vote for a 715 billion military budget more than the 10 next countries combined what we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy ending conflicts by people sitting at a table not by killing each other as president of the united states i will go to the united nations and not denigrate it not attack the un but bring countries together in the middle east and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully the united states,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator,3
Bernie Sanders,  cannot be the policeman of the world,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator governor hickenlooper how do you respond to senator sanders vision for americas role in the world,3
John Hickenloop, well we share the recognition of the incredible cost people dont realize that half the soldiers that fought in iraq and afghanistan were national guard so i went and sent them off in their deployments big noisy hangers but i also mourned with their families when they didnt come back,3
John Hickenloop, we are able now to i call it constant engagement but we should have an international diplomatic approach where were talking to everybody because if were going to deal with climate change and cybersecurity and nuclear proliferation weve got to be talking to everybody and tariff wars dont work,3
Speaker 12, thank you governor,3
John Hickenloop, theyre for losers,3
Speaker 12, thank you governor i want to go to congressman ryan and i want to turn to the subject of north korea which just hours ago launched two shortrange ballistic missiles for the second time in less than a week congressman youve said that you would not meet with north korean dictator kim jongun unless you were at least close to a deal now senator klobuchar says that she would always be willing to meet with leaders to discuss policies is that view wrong,3
Tim Ryan, yeah i think so i love amy klobuchar but i think shes wrong on this one i dont think presidents of the united states meet with dictators we saw what just happened with president trump he goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of north korea gives him a huge photo op gives him global credibility because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there and meeting with him and weeks later hes lobbing more missiles,3
Tim Ryan, that doesnt make any sense weve got to demilitarize our foreign policy weve got to make sure that we are engaging these countries all the time this is very difficult work ive been in congress 17 years i sit on a defense appropriations committee i sat on the armed services committee this is long tedious work much of it done outside of the eye of the tv camera and as president youve got to monitor that and be very disciplined every day dont go give a dictator a huge win sit down and do your job,3
Tim Ryan, and the same thing with whats happening in central america hes cutting the state department budget nicaragua guatemala el salvador,3
Speaker 12, thank you congressman,3
Tim Ryan,  where the migrants are coming from go fix the problem at its source and use diplomacy to do it,3
Speaker 12, senator klobuchar your response,3
Amy Klobuchar, i think we agree i just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place,3
Amy Klobuchar, what i dont like is how this president has handled it youve heard of the truman doctrine the monroe doctrine hes done the go it alone doctrine with the rest of the world hes taken us out of the climate change agreement out of the iran nuclear agreement out of the russian nuclear agreement and i dont agree with that,3
Amy Klobuchar, and when he was just with vladimir putin at the g20 when he was asked about invading our democracy he made a joke hundreds of thousands of americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote,3
Speaker 12, thank you,3
Amy Klobuchar, four little girls in birmingham alabama lost their life in a church at the heights,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator,3
Amy Klobuchar,  of the civil rights amendment so i do believe you meet with people but you better have an agenda,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator,3
Amy Klobuchar, and you better put our interests of our country first not the russians,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator klobuchar mayor buttigieg you served in afghanistan where just yesterday two us service members were killed there are currently about 14000 us service members in afghanistan youve said one thing everybody can agree on is that were getting out of afghanistan will you withdraw all us service members by the end of your first year in office,3
Pete Buttigieg, we will withdraw we have to,3
Speaker 12, in your first year,3
Pete Buttigieg, yes look around the world we will do whatever it takes to keep america safe but i thought i was one of the last troops leaving afghanistan when i thought i was turning out the lights years ago,3
Pete Buttigieg, every time i see news about somebody being killed in afghanistan i think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that i served with somebody that i knew a friend roommate colleague,3
Pete Buttigieg, were pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in afghanistan who was not born on 911 i was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as the president and we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war but the fact that congress has been asleep at the switch,3
Pete Buttigieg, and on my watch i will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a threeyear sunset and have to be renewed because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve members of congress ought to have to summon,3
Speaker 12, thank you mayor,3
Pete Buttigieg,  the courage to vote on whether they ought to ,3
Speaker 12, thank you mayor i want to bring in congressmen orourke congressmen orourke responding returning rather to the question of whether you would withdraw all us service members from afghanistan during your first year in office as president how do you respond sir,3
Beto O’Rourke, i would in my first term in office agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war already in its 18th year that will make it any better weve satisfied the reasons for our involvement in afghanistan in the first place and its time to bring those service members back home from afghanistan but also from iraq also from yemen and somalia and libya and syria,3
Beto O’Rourke, there is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight as president i will end those wars and we will not start new wars we will not send more us service members overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name we can resolve,3
Speaker 12, thank you congressman,3
Beto O’Rourke,  these challenges peacefully and diplomatically,3
Speaker 12, thank you congressman governor hickenlooper you disagree youve said that youre open to keeping some service members in afghanistan beyond your first term,3
John Hickenloop, i look at it as a,3
Speaker 12, please respond,3
John Hickenloop,  humanitarian issue and with all due respect youre looking at the condition of women if we completely,3
Marianne Willia, thank you,3
John Hickenloop,  pull our troops out of there youre going to see a humanitarian disaster that will startle and frighten every man woman and child in this country,3
John Hickenloop, i mean we have troops in over 400 different locations around the world most of them are small theyre peacekeeping theyre not greatly at risk were going to have to be in afghanistan look at the progress thats happened in that country were going to turn our backs and walk away from people that have risked their lives to help them build a different future for afghanistan and that part of the world,3
Speaker 12, thank you governor thank you governor senator warren you want to make it us policy that the us will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first now president obama reportedly considered that policy but ultimately decided against it why should the us tie its own hands with that policy,3
Elizabeth Warre, because it makes the world safer the united states is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively and we need to say so to the entire world it reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculate someone misunderstands,3
Elizabeth Warre, our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe and whats happening right now with donald trump as they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons the different ways that they can be used puts us all at risk,3
Elizabeth Warre, you know we talk about whats happening around the world i have three older brothers who served in the military i see that they would do anything our military is the best on earth but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution we need to use our diplomatic tools our economic tools and if were going to send someone into war we better have a plan for how were going to get them out on the other end,3
Speaker 12, thank you senator governor bullock your response to senator warrens proposal to the us never use a nuclear weapon first,3
Steve Bullock, i wouldnt want to take that off the table i think americas strength we have to be able to say that,3
Steve Bullock, look never i hope certainly in my term or anyone else would we really even get close to pulling that trigger but by the same token americas strength and look this presidents made american first is america alone our allies no longer trust us our adversaries are with us but going from a position of strength we should be negotiating down so there arent nuclear weapons but drawing those lines in sand at this point i wouldnt do,3
Speaker 12, thank you governor senator warren your response,3
Elizabeth Warre, we dont expand trust around the world by saying no we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon that puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this at a time when donald trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world has pulled us out of the deal in iran and iran is now working on its nuclear weapon the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare,3
Speaker 1,  senator,3
Elizabeth Warre, we have to have an,3
Speaker 1, senator,3
Elizabeth Warre,  announced policy that is one the entire world can live with we need to make that clear we will respond,3
Speaker 1, thank you senator warren,3
Elizabeth Warre,  if someone else does but not first,3
Speaker 1, governor bullock please respond,3
Steve Bullock, part i agree with but by the  like we need to get back to nuclear proliferation,3
Elizabeth Warre, what,3
Steve Bullock, but when you have folks deproliferation reducing that but at the same time when you actually have korea when you have others i dont want to turn around and say well detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that when so many crazy folks are getting closer to having nuclear weapon i dont want them to think i could strike this country and i and we as the united states of america wouldnt do a thing part of the strength really is the ability to deter,3
Speaker 1, governor bullock  governor thank you very much moving on now,3
Bernie Sanders, could i add something to that discussion,3
Speaker 1, moving on now please senator senator please moving on now as you know to serve as president of the united states all of you know this you have to be at least 35 years old so mayor buttigieg you just qualified youre 37 the youngest candidate in this field standing next to you is the oldest candidate bernie sanders at age 77 should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate,3
Pete Buttigieg, i dont care how old you are i care about your vision but i do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world leaders like the i actually think its good that the prime minister of new zealand has gotten a lot of attention in democratic debates shes masterful she is younger than i would be when i take office,3
Pete Buttigieg, this is the kind of trend america might be leading instead of following but only if its actually backed by the right vision and we can have great presidents at any age what i will say is we need the kind of vision thats going to win we cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal because the only reason we got this president is that normal didnt work we have to be ready to take on this president,3
Pete Buttigieg, and by the way something that hasnt been talked about as much tonight take on his enablers in congress you know when david duke when david duke ran for congress ran for governor the republican party 20 years ago ran away from him today they are supporting naked racism in the white house who were at best silent about it,3
Pete Buttigieg, and if you were watching this at home and you are a republican member of congress consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president you found the courage to stand up to him or you continue to put party over country,3
Speaker 1, thank you mayor senator sanders as the senior statesman of the group please respond to mayor buttigieg,3
Bernie Sanders, well pete is right its a question of vision thats what it is whether youre young whether youre old whether youre in between and my vision among other things says that if were going to fight for healthcare we dont take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies and i have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who in my view are going to war against the american people in terms of healthcare thats a new vision,3
Bernie Sanders, a new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today for the first time in modern american history will have a lower standard of living than their parents,3
Speaker 1, thank you senator sanders the debate continues right after this  please,3
Jake Tapper, we have covered a lot of ground tonight now it is time for closing statements you will each receive one minute governor bullock were going to begin with you,3
Steve Bullock, thanks jake i was raised in a single parent household at times paycheck to paycheck only knew there was a governors house in town because i delivered newspapers to it so ive made it about four blocks in life worked my way through college paid my way through law school i had a chance to actually go from delivering newspapers to the governors house as a kid to now raising our three kids in it,3
Steve Bullock, weve got to recognize for far too many people in america that shot no longer exists for far too many in this country it never has im running for president to beat donald trump win back the places we lost and make sure that americans know that where washingtons left them behind in their economy and their political system ill be there,3
Steve Bullock, this isnt a choice just between center and left we dont have to choose between what we dont want and what we cant afford folks want a different way they want to believe the economy and our democracy can work for us thats why im running for president,3
Jake Tapper, thank you miss williamson,3
M. Williamson, yes our problem is not just that we need to defeat donald trump we need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred collectivized hatred and white nationalism in order to do that we need more than political insight or game and wonkiness and intellectual argument those things will not defeat donald trump,3
M. Williamson, we need some radical truth telling not just to talk about healthcare but talk about why were so sick all the time we need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed even on the subject of foreign policy its all about symptoms and not about cars we need to talk about the fact that the united states has sacrificed our moral leadership the fact that countries see us not only domestically but internationally with policies that simply support our corporate overlords,3
M. Williamson, the fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by shortterm profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace building theres some corruption thats so deep ladies and gentleman until the democratic party is ready to speak to deeper corruption knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated then im afraid those who vote for trump will continue to vote for trump and those who might not like donald trump will continue to stay home,3
M. Williamson, i want a politics that goes much deeper i want a politics that speaks to the heart because the only way to fight  you keep talking about how were going to fight donald trump you cant fight dog whistles you have to override them the only way you can override them is with new voices voices of energy that only come from the fact that america has been willing to live up to our own mistakes atone for our own mistakes make amends for our own mistakes love each other love our democracy love future generations something emotional and psychological that will not be emerging from anything on this stage it will emerge from something im the one whos qualified to bring forth,3
Jake Tapper, congressman delaney,3
John Delaney, thank you jake john f kennedy famously said we should not seek the republican answer we should not seek the democratic answer we should seek the right answer he was right when he said and hes right today as well,3
John Delaney, donald trump is the symptom of a disease and the disease is divisiveness im the only one on this stage talking about curing that disease with big ideas like national service by focusing on actually solving problems if we work together we can fix healthcare and build infrastructure we can invest in not just technology but people and entrepreneurs whether they be in storm lake iowa or detroit michigan or baltimore maryland,3
John Delaney, we can fight climate change and reimagine our education system but we have to do it with real solutions not impossible promises isnt it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government to lead us into the future i promise as president i will restore vision unity and leadership and decency to this country thats why im running for president thank you,3
Jake Tapper, congressman ryan,3

Tim Ryan, a new and better economy a new and better education system a new and better healthcare system that focuses on prevention an education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids theres not going to be a savior not going to be a superstar thats going to fix all this its going to be you and me its going to be us thats how we fix this country you and i coming together to do big things to imagine the new country that we want by coming together not left or right new and better,3
Jake Tapper, governor hickenlooper,3
J. Hickenlooper, thank you what a night ive loved it id like to ask every american to imagine that you are facing life threatening surgery tomorrow would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success whod actually done the work or someone who had just talked about it thats the question were facing in this primary,3
J. Hickenlooper, ive actually got a track record as a small business owner as a mayor and as a governor we expanded healthcare in colorado and got near universal coverage we fought climate change directly we beat the nra for the last three years weve been the number one economy in the country we can ramp all that out,3
J. Hickenlooper, im as progressive as anybody up on this stage but im also pragmatic ive done the things that most of these other people are just talking about and i know i can get results i can lead the people of this country toward a stronger a healthier and a more secure future and defeat donald trump and return this country to its glory thank you,3
Jake Tapper, senator,3
Amy Klobuchar, well thank you detroit to win we have to listen to people out there today is casey joes mom casey joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town she got sick went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids the last thing that she said to her mom was momma its not my fault and she died,3
Amy Klobuchar, a lot of americans say the same thing every day and that is what i will stand up for what i will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didnt tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen,3
Amy Klobuchar, we need someone that has peoples back we also need someone that can win and i have won in these red districts i win in the midwest i can win in states like wisconsin and michigan and iowa i also will do my job without fear or favor just like i did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like ive done as a senator where ive passed over a hundred bills where ive been the lead democrat,3
Amy Klobuchar, last yes i will govern with integrity we have the president where people turn off their tv when they see him not me i will make you proud as your president,3
Jake Tapper, congressman orourke,3
Beto O’Rourke, we are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been right now we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart to meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone,3
Beto O’Rourke, my whole life ive been including people in the success of this country starting a business with high value high wage high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in america serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that i serve at the end of the day in congress being in the minority but working with democrats and republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country,3
Beto O’Rourke, then in texas this last year traveling to every county not writing anybody off not taking anyone for granted at the end of the day winning more votes than any democrat had in the history of the state winning independence for the first time in decades and winning nearly half a million republicans and those 38 electoral college votes in texas are now in play i can win them that is how we defeat donald trump in november of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in january of 2021 thank you,3
Jake Tapper, mayor buttigieg,3
Pete Buttigieg, theres good news and bad news im going to start with the bad news our countrys in trouble gpd is going up and life expectancy is going down think about what that means its only getting tougher by 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate there could be 130 million more guns on our streets ill be in my 40s then if you have kids think about how old they will be then,3
Pete Buttigieg, heres the good news its not too late we can tell our kids that before we ran out of time just before we ran out of time in 2020 we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didnt have to wonder if it could support us to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats,3
Pete Buttigieg, we can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasnt worked with bold action and win not only defeat this president but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the republican party with its conscience as well as bringing democrats to office join me and lets make it happen,3
Jake Tapper, senator warren,3
E. Warren, from the time i was seven years old i had a dream i wanted to be a public school teacher but my daddy ended up as a janitor by the time i graduated from high school my family didnt have the money to send me off to college my big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost 50 a semester,3
E. Warren, for me what this election is all about is opportunity every budget every policy that we talk about is about whos going to get opportunity is it going to go to the billionaires or is it going to go to our kids right now for decades we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful it has been on the side of the wealthy that means it has not been on the side of everyone else not on the side of people living on our native american reservations people living in inner cities people living on small farms and small communities across this country,3
E. Warren, how do we beat it we beat it by being the party of big structural change give people a reason to show up and vote we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it personbyperson across this country with small dollar donations with volunteers with people who show up and say i have a stake in this democracy,3
E. Warren, i will not only beat donald trump in 2020 ill start to make real change come 2021,3
Jake Tapper, senator sanders,3
Bernie Sanders, as somebody who grew up in a family that lived in a rent controlled apartment in brooklyn new york and lived paycheck to paycheck im running for president not just to defeat the most dangerous president in this history of this country a guy whos a racist and a sexist and a homophobe im running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of america which for the last 45 years has been decimated,3
Bernie Sanders, two days ago i had a remarkable experience which should tell you everything you need to know about whats going on in america i took 15 people with diabetes from detroit a few miles into canada and we bought insulin for onetenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in america today,3
Bernie Sanders, its not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry its whats going on in the fossil fuel industry its whats going on in wall street its whats going on with the prison industrial complex we need a mass political movement,3
Bernie Sanders, please go to berniesanderscom become one of our million volunteers stand up and take on the greed and corruption of the ruling class of this country lets create a government and an economy that works for all of us not just the one percent,3
Jake Tapper, candidates thank you so much that completes tonights debate join us tomorrow night at 800 pm eastern time for round two ten more democratic candidates for president right back here in detroit now stay tuned for special coverage of tonights debate with anderson cooper and chris cuomo that begins right now,3
Anderson Cooper, there you have it night one of the cnn democratic debates here in detroit it certainly lived up to the billing in many ways we saw candidates clashing onstage sometimes sharply on policy without resorting to name calling at all we saw bernie sanders and elizabeth warren answer tough questions from their opponents and the panel on healthcare and how to pay for it,3
Anderson Cooper, there is certainly a clear divide in the democratic party right now across a wide range of issues and that too played out onstage now whether or not as senator warren said a moment ago democrats want to be the party of big structural change it was a serious clash of ideas certainly and philosophies and yes personalities as well,3
Anderson Cooper, if you came into this looking to learn what exactly democrats believed what they think is good for the country and what they think is the best way to beat donald trump well it was all there tonight on that stage were going to focus on all of it in the hours ahead my colleague chris cuomo and i will be talking to some of the candidates who you saw tonight well of course be joined by some of the best political and journalistic voices around as well,3
Anderson Cooper, cnn chief national correspondent john king is with us host of cnns inside politics cnns senior political reporter niamalika henderson is with us as well cnns senior political commentator axe files host and former senior obama advisor david axelrod joins us here cnns chief political analyst gloria borger is with us as well so is cnn political commentator and former clinton 2016 director of communications outreach jess mcintosh also van jones host of cnns van jones show two cnn political commentators joining us as well both are former governors jennifer granholm of michigan and terry mcauliffe of virginia,3
Anderson Cooper, a lot to talk about john king lets start with you who stood out to you,3
John King, well what stood out to me i think is the most important the ideological and generational fight in the democratic party is alive and well and feisty it was not settled tonight right,3
Anderson Cooper, it continues,3
John King, it continues and its going to continue i think deep into the primary season the big challenge tonight is the great question after tonight and tomorrow night who gets to continue the fight so elizabeth warren and bernie sanders stood their ground tonight they were in the middle of the stage they were challenged repeatedly can you sell these big ideas is the country ready for this can the country afford this will you hand donald trump reelection i think they both stood feistily and fought back,3
John King, elizabeth warren from the very beginning saying dont have small ideas and dont be spineless a direct challenge to those who were challenging her and senator sanders they did not go at each other they will have to some day they hold too much space in this primary to not have a fight at some point but that was delayed as they held their ground against the moderates,3
John King, i think the big question is which of the moderates survive thats not up to us thats up to democratic donors and democratic voters who have to either send them money or raise them in the polls because this in some ways i dont want to make it reality tv is about survival to make the next round of debates several of those moderates right now dont meet the test,3
John King, so governor bullock pretty decent night do voters believe that does he rise up in the polls does he get some money,3
Anderson Cooper, its also his first night on a debate stage,3
John King, first night so he tried to have his introduction as im from the trump state i agree with you on principle bernie and senator warren but not on how you want to do it the democratic voters are going to decide who gets to live to fight on but wow this is a feisty policybased ideological fight its going to go for a long time,3
Anderson Cooper, niamalika henderson certainly former representative delaney got a fair amount of attention as a foil to elizabeth warren and bernie sanders,3
N. Henderson, he did that was i think one of the best exchanges that warren had with delaney when she essentially said whats the presidency for what are you running for presidency for if its all about what you cant get done and its all about what youre afraid of she kept essentially saying that the moderates were basically spouting gop talking points and why are the moderates getting caught in that trap,3
N. Henderson, it was really interesting because you ,3
Jake Tapper, welcome back to the cnn democratic presidential debate candidates were about to begin opening statements but first a quick review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to try to ensure a fair debate as moderators we will attempt to guide the discussion you will each receive one minute to answer questions 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification the timing lights will remind you of these limits please respect them and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time a candidate infringing on another candidates time will have his or her time reduced we again remind our audience inside the fox theater to try to remain silent when candidates are actively debating the candidates need to be able to properly hear the questions and each other,4
Dana Bash, lets start with opening statements you will each receive one minute mayor bill de blasio please begin,4
Bill de Blasio, to the working people of america tonight i bring you a message of hope we can make change in this country i know from personal experience it can be done when i became the mayor of the nations largest city i set us on a path of bold change they said it couldnt be done but we gave prek to every child for free we got rid of stop and frisk and we lowered crime we raise the minimum wage to 1500 an hour yes it can be done now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as democrats there are good people on this stage but there are real differences joe biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president,4
Bill de Blasio, kamala harris said shes not trying to restructure society well i am for 40 years working people have taken it on the chin in this country for 40 years the rich and gotten richer and they paid less and less in taxes it cannot go on this way when i am president we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure its a country that puts working people first,4
Dana Bash, thank you mayor de blasio senator michael bennet,4
Michael Bennet, thank you last week i saw one of those trump signs that says america love it or leave it and it was on the outside of the church i love america and i know we can make it better before coming to the senate i ran a large urban school district where most of the kids live in poverty those kids have exactly the same hopes that i had their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me and that susan and i had for our three children but for the last three years weve been consumed by a president who frankly doesnt give a damn about your kids or mine mr president kids belong in classrooms not cages and they deserve something better than a bully in the white house lets end this three ring circus in washington and lets make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy empty promises wont beat donald trump i can,4
Dana Bash, governor jay inslee,4
Jay Inslee, good evening im jay inslee i am running for president because the people in this room and the democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet if we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the united states we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our childrens future it has to be our top priority my plan is one of national mobilization quickly bringing 100 clean energy to americans creating eight million good union jobs this is a big bold ambitious plan for clean energy for a big bold ambitious nation middle ground approaches are not enough we must confront the fossil fuel industry ive been working on this for 25 years and now we know this were a tipping point and whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time we democrats believe we can still do big things in this nation we can defeat the climate crisis lets get to work,4
Dana Bash, senator kirsten gillibrand,4
Kirsten G., my grandmother taught me that nothings impossible she spent two generations organizing women in upstate new york my mother taught me nothings impossible she was one of my only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights if you want to get something done just tell me its impossible as a freshman senator i was told you couldnt repeal dont ask dont tell even numbers of my own party told me it wasnt convenient when are civil rights ever convenient we stood up to the pentagon and we got it done not impossible 10 years ago i was told you couldnt pass healthcare for our 911 first responders those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down even when congress turned its back on them we kept fighting just last week we made the 911 health bill permanent beating donald trump definitely not impossible we need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win we need a nominee who doesnt know the meaning of impossible,4
Dana Bash, congresswoman tulsi gabbard,4
Tulsi Gabbard, i love our country its why i enlisted after 911 where ive served as a soldier for over 16 years deployed twice to the middle east and serve in congress now for almost seven years i know what patriotism is and ive known many great patriots throughout my life and let me tell you this donald trump is not behaving like a patriot as president i will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the white house serving the interest of all americans not just the rich and powerful ill fight for our rights and freedoms of all americans upholding these principles in our constitution upon which our country was founded fighting for justice and equality for all fighting for every single american regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that more perfect union and as president ill bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldiers values of service above self to the white house truly leading a government of by and for the people,4
Dana Bash, secretary julian castro,4
Julian Castro, thank you dana and good evening just a few days ago we were reminded and inspired by our fellow americans in puerto rico that public service is not fundamentally about any of us its about you and your family i want you to know that if im elected president that i will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good healthcare when you need it so that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams and then you can have good job opportunities whether you live here in a big city like detroit or in a small town in our country i know we have a wonderful special nation but that too many people are struggling and i know what thats like too i grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood but like many of you i dont want to make america anything again i dont want us to go backwards were not going back to the past were not going back where we came from were going to move forward were going to make america better than its ever been in the years to come lets do that together,4
Dana Bash, andrew yang,4
Andrew Yang, if you heard anything about me and my campaign youve heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every american 1000 a month i know this may sound like a gimmick but this is a deeply american idea from thomas payne to martin luther king to today let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it why do we need to do it we already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next if you dont believe me just ask an auto worker here in detroit how do we pay for it raise your hand in the crowd if youve seen stores closing where you live it is not just you amazon is closing 30 of americas stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it we need to do the opposite of much of what were doing right now and the opposite of donald trump is an asian man who likes math so let me share the math on 1000 a month for every adult would be 461 million every month right here in detroit alone the automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today it is why donald trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the american people,4
Dana Bash, senator cory booker,4
Cory Booker, thank you dana last week the president of the united states attacked an american city calling it a disgusting rat infested rodent mess we need a nation that understands that these tired old language,4
Speaker 1, stand by senator,4
Cory Booker, i will stand by,4
Speaker 1, please stand by,4
Speaker 1, please continue senator,4
Cory Booker, thank you very much donald trump from charleston to baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demagogues of fearmongers of racists to try to divide our country against itself we know who donald trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people we have serious problems in america we have deep wounds and seriously deeply rooted challenges we desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward because we know in this country that our fates are united that we have a common destiny the call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose thats how we will beat donald trump thats how i will beat donald trump and as your president thats how i will govern and move us forward together,4
Dana Bash, senator kamala harris,4
Kamala Harris, this is an inflection moment in the history of our country i think we all know that this is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask the question that question being who are we and i think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this so this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course we will and this is not a new fight for us as americans we have always been prepared to fight for our ideals we have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are and ill tell you i come from fighters my parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement my sister maya and i joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice and i am prepared to march with you to fight with you for the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of donald trump and against him,4
Dana Bash, vice president joe biden,4
Joe Biden, tonight i think democrats are expecting some engagement here and i expect well get it im running for president to restore the soul of this country we have a president as everybodys acknowledged here every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country but no one man has the capacity to rip that apart its too strong were too good just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds went on to be mayors senators governors congresswomen members of the cabinet and yes even a vice president mr president this is america and we are stronger and great because of this diversity mr president not in spite of it mr president so mr president lets get something straight we love it we are not leaving it we are here to stay and were certainly not going to leave it to you,4
Dana Bash, thank you vice president biden i want to start the debate with one of the top priorities for democratic voters and that is healthcare senator harris this week you released a new healthcare plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in vice president bidens campaign calls your plan a haveiteverywhichway approach and says its just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your healthcare stance what do you say to that,4
Kamala Harris, well theyre probably confused because theyve not read it but the reality is that i have been spending time in this campaign listening to american families listening to experts listening to healthcare providers and what i came away with is a very clear understanding that i needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the american people responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long that american families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy,4
Kamala Harris, i listened to the american families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan so i devised a plan where its going to be 10 years of a transition i listened to american families who said i want an option that will be under your medicare system that allows a private plan so i designed a plan where yes responsive to the needs of american families there will be a public plan under my plan for medicare and a private plan under my plan for medicare because the bottom line is this we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it and in america today far too many people in fact 30 million people are going without access to healthcare,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator harris vice president biden your response,4
Joe Biden, well my response is that is the senators had several plans so far and anytime someone tells you youre going to get something good in 10 years you should wonder why it takes 10 years if you noticed theres no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost 3 trillion you will lose your employer based insurance and in fact this is the single most important issue facing the public and to be very blunt and to be very straightforward you cant beat president trump with double talk on this plan,4
Dana Bash, your response senator harris,4
Kamala Harris, absolutely unfortunately vice president biden youre just simply inaccurate in what youre describing the reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all americans under a medicare for all system our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in america or every year in america under our plan we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare your plan by contrast leaves out almost 10 million americans so i think that you should really think about what youre saying but be reflective and understand that the people of america want access to healthcare and do not want costs to be their barrier to getting it,4
Dana Bash, senator harris thank you vice president biden your response,4
Joe Biden, the plan no matter how you cut it cost 3 trillion when it is in fact employed number one 10 years from now after two terms of the senator being president after her time secondly it will require middleclass taxes to go up not down thirdly it will eliminate employer based insurance and fourthly what happens in the meantime,4
Kamala Harris, id like to respond first of all the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive second we are now paying 3 trillion a year for healthcare in america over the next 10 years its probably going to be 6 trillion we must act my plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage right now in america we have seniors who everyday millions of seniors are going into the medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need all people should have access to healthcare and and costs should not be,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator harris mayor de blasio lets bring you in here whats your response,4
Bill de Blasio, thank you i dont know what the vice president or senator are talking about the folks i talked to about health insurance say that their health insurance isnt working for them theres tens of millions of americans who dont even have health insurance tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays the deductibles the premiums the outofpocket expenses theres this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in america what i hear from union members and from hardworking middleclass people is they wish they had better insurance,4
Bill de Blasio, from hardworking middle class people is they wish they had better insurance and theyre angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental health care dental care,4
Dana Bash, thank you mr mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, the things that would be full coverage for all americans,4
Dana Bash, thank you mr mayor vice president biden you just heard mayor deblasio he said in the past that democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a healthcare system that is not working whats your response,4
Joe Biden, my response is obamacare is working the way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on obamacare go back and do take back all the things that trump took away provide a public option meaning every single person in america would be able to buy into the option if they didnt like their employer plan or if theyre on medicaid theyd automatically be in the plan it would be taking place immediately it would move quickly and it would insure the vast vast vast majority of americans,4
Joe Biden, in the mean time what happens did anybody tell you how much their plans cost my plans cost 750 billion dollars thats what it costs not 30 trillion dollars,4
Dana Bash, thank you mr vice president senator gillibrand you support medicare for all how do you feel about senator harris continuing to call her health proposal medicare for all when it includes a far more significant role for private insurance than the bill you cosponsored,4
Kirsten G., i think for the viewers in the audience right now theyre at risk of losing the forest through the trees because the truth is healthcare in america should be a right when i was a young mother and had theo as an infant he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy i had to rush him to the emergency room my heart is palpitating because im worried that his throat will close i am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet i know whatever theyre going to prescribe whether its an epipen or an inhaler i can afford it the truth about healthcare in america today is people cant afford it they cannot afford and these insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies im sorry,4
Kirsten G., theyre for profit companies they have an obligation to their shareholders they pay their ceo millions of dollars they have to have quarterly profits they have fat in the system thats real and it should be going to healthcare so lets not lose the forest through the trees and last lets not forget what the republicans are doing because the truth is the republicans and trump their whole goal is to take away your healthcare,4
Dana Bash, thank you,4
Kirsten G., to make it harder for you to afford it even if you have a preexisting condition,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator gillibrand senator harris in response,4
Kamala Harris, in response to senator biden about the affordable care act it is important that you understand that our medicare for all plan has actually by the architect of the obama affordable care act been described as one of the most effective way to bring healthcare to all kathleen sibelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go in terms of the point that senator gillibrand is raising i couldnt agree more senator biden your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo doing business as usual and thats going to be about jacking up copays jacking up deductibles,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, it will still be the situation,4
Dana Bash,  thank you senator harris,4
Kamala Harris, that people going to an emergency room have to come out 5000,4
Dana Bash,  vice president biden your response,4
Joe Biden, my plan makes a limit of copay to be 1000 because we further support the ability to buy in to the obamacare plan secondly the idea that this is somehow a bad idea no one has to keep their private insurance but if they like their insurance they should be able to keep it nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance it says if the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance they should have a right to have it if they dont they can buy in to the biden plan which is obamacare with a,4
Dana Bash, thank you mr vice president thank you senator booker let me bring you in here you say you support medicare for all you also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million americans in exchange for a government plan but thats what medicare for all would do so how do you square that,4
Cory Booker, well first of all let me just say that the person thats enjoying this debate most right now is donald trump as we pit democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away americans healthcare theres a court case working through the system thats going to gut the affordable care act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions and so i was raised by two civil rights parents who told me to always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that the united states of america every democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare that its a human right and how we get there it has to be to end this broken system because we are on our way in just a handful of years of literally spending 20 of our economy one out of every 5 spent on healthcare,4
Cory Booker, and we spend more than every other nation on everything from mris to insulin drugs multiple more than other countries and so you want to know what im going to do im going to work to get us to a point where medicare for all where everyone is covered but this pitting against progressives against moderates saying one is unrealistic and the other doesnt care enough that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator,4
Cory Booker,  and im going to keep fighting for that,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator booker congressman gabbard whats your response,4
Tulsi Gabbard, the reality is right now we dont have a healthcare system we have a sick care system and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it so the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies whove been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table writing this legislation now kamala harris just talked about kathleen sibelius who helped write her bill this just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal,4
Tulsi Gabbard, sibelius works for medicare advantage private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan if were seeking to really reform our healthcare system weve got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so that they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care,4
Dana Bash, senator harris your response,4
Kamala Harris, well unfortunately representative gabbard got it wrong kathleen sibelius did not write my plan she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyones going to have access to healthcare in america and when we talk about this again im going to go back to vice president biden because your plan does not cover everyone in america by your staffs and your own definition 10 million people as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare and in 2019 in america for a democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone i think is without excuse,4
Kamala Harris, our plan covers everyone,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, and gives people choice,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator vice president biden your response,4
Joe Biden, my plan will cover everyone number one number two the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices the bio pharma is now where things are going to go its no longer chemicals its about all these breakthroughs we have with generally the whole excuse me immune system and what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the hhs and says as you develop a drug youve got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for we will set the price and secondly it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr vice president,4
Joe Biden,  to end the,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in senator bennet last night on this stage one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on medicare for all would get donald trump reelected do you agree with that sir,4
Michael Bennet, i agree that it makes it much more likely unlike others on this stage ive been crystal clear of where ive been for a decade through two tough races in colorado i believe we should finish the job we started with the affordable care act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance,4
Michael Bennet, it requires drug companies to be negotiated with by medicare and it provides competition that is totally different from the plan that senator warren and senator sanders and senator harris have proposed which would make illegal employerbased health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of 30 trillion dollars as joe biden said we dont need to do that it doesnt make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we can pass a public option trust the american people to make the right decision and have universal healthcare in this country in two years not 10 years,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator secretary castro i want to bring you in,4
Kamala Harris, i need to respond,4
Jake Tapper, your response ill come to you right after secretary castro secretary castro,4
Julian Castro, well i know that this is something very personal for all americans i grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and i watched as her condition got worse and worse that whole time she had medicare i want to strengthen medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it i also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold onto that they should be able to do that what i dont believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation whether somebody gets healthcare or not,4
Jake Tapper, thank you secretary castro senator harris senator bennet had suggested that you support banning employerbased health insurance is that true,4
Kamala Harris, well first of all with all due respect to my friend michael bennet my plan does not offer anything that is illegal what it does is it separates the employer from healthcare meaning that where you work will not be a the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work i have met so many americans who stick to a job that they do not like where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides,4
Kamala Harris, its time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan we do that as it relates to the insurance and pharmaceutical companies,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by senator biden or senator bennets plan,4
Jake Tapper,  thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, we will do that,4
Jake Tapper, senator bennet i want to bring you back,4
Michael Bennet, senator harris is my friend as well but i have to say if we cant admit tonight whats in the plan which is banning employerbased insurance were not going to be able to admit that when donald trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well we need to be honest about whats in this plan it bans employerbased insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of 30 trillion dollars do you know how much that is that is 70 of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years we dont need to do that,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator governor inslee im going to come to you in a second but i do want to,4
Michael Bennet,  we can have a public option and have,4
Jake Tapper, come to you in a second but i do want to i do want to,4
Michael Bennet,  universal healthcare in this country,4
Jake Tapper, i do want to bring in senator harris because he suggested you were not being honest,4
Kamala Harris, we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this you got to stop the reality is that under my medicare for all plan yes employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get they will be able to make that decision private insurance companies and private carriers if they comply by our rules and play by our rules well be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private medicare plan or they can have the option of a public medicare plan but it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only they want choice and my plan gives that to them,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator governor inslee i want to bring you in you recently signed a public option into law which allows washington state residents to purchase a statebacked plan if they want to but this may only save families in washington state as little as 5 off premiums is 5 really the kind of relief that the american people need,4
Jay Inslee, no we need universal coverage and im proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done and i am proud that we are the first state to offer a publicly sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens im also proud that we didnt stop there were also the first state that has taken care of our elders our seniors we have a looming retirement wave coming up im proud that our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity,4
Jay Inslee, im also proud of this and i think we need to talk more about this as democrats it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country and we are having we are having some success in integrating mental health with physical health theres no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health and the last thing were doing i think its very instructive for the nation we know were being eaten alive by pharmaceutical costs weve had one of if not the most innovate way to drive down pharmaceuticals for lifesaving medications in the united states thats a record of washington state id like to take to washington dc,4
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you governor inslee mr yang i want to bring you in you support a medicare for all system how do you respond to governor inslee,4
Andrew Yang, i just want to share a story when i told my wife i was running for president you know the first question she asked me what are we going to do about our healthcare thats a true story and its not just us democrats are talking about healthcare in the wrong way as someone whos run a business i can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as fulltime employees it makes it harder to switch jobs as senator harris just said and its certainly a lot harder to start a business if we say look were going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families then watch american entrepreneurship recover and bloom thats the argument we should be making to the american people,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr yang mayor deblasio,4
Bill de Blasio, yeah i dont understand why democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal healthcare it makes no sense ask the american people they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies they feel its holding back their families because they cant get the coverage they need they get a lot of nos they dont get a lot of help from health insurance companies why are we not going to be the party that does something bold that says we dont need to be dependent on private insurance we could have a system that actually covers everyone,4
Bill de Blasio, you know what donald trump won this state of michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo how about we be the party thats going to disrupt the status quo,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Bill de Blasio, for working people,4
Jake Tapper, mr mayor just a 15second point of clarification who are you talking about whos fear mongering,4
Bill de Blasio, certainly with all due respect to senator bennet what hes saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes americans right now are paying so much money for their healthcare ask people about the reality of premiums deductibles copays outofpocket expenses,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Bill de Blasio, thats worse than any tax,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Bill de Blasio, and people are paying that right now,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr mayor senator bennet,4
Michael Bennet, this has nothing to do with republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry this has to do with having faith in the american people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option bernie sanders who said last night he wrote the damn bill and he did just like i wrote the damn public option bill is the guy who says itll cost 32 trillion dollars and then were going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it he says that republicans dont say it dont try to distract from the truth,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Michael Bennet, you cant hide from the truth here,4
Jake Tapper,  i want to let mayor deblasio and then im going to come to you,4
Michael Bennet,  we need to be for universal healthcare,4
Jake Tapper, vice president biden,4
Bill de Blasio, senator if we as democrats say were done with private insurance it has only hurt the american people in so many ways were going to give them something that works for their families full coverage that they can depend on if we say that then theres an election the american people get to decide the ultimate choice senator is an election and this should be the party that stands for universal healthcare and says were not going to accept anything less right now in america so many people dont have the healthcare they need that is a fact tens of millions of people including,4
Jake Tapper,  thank you mr mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, middle class people,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, give them a chance to make that decision,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, through an election,4
Jake Tapper, vice president biden your response sir,4
Joe Biden, this is not a republican talking point the republicans are trying to kill obamacare obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat a hundred million people with preexisting conditions and in fact what we got is a public option that in fact would allow anybody to buy in no one has to keep their private insurance they can buy into this plan and they can buy into it with a 1000 deductible and never have to pay more than 85 of their income when they do it and if they dont have any money theyll get in free so this idea is a bunch of malarkey what were talking about here,4
Joe Biden, the fact of the matter is the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible itll be a deductible in their paycheck bernie acknowledges it bernie acknowledges 30 trillion dollars has to all be paid and i dont know what math you do in new york i dont know what math you do in california but i tell you thats a lot of money and there will be a deductible the deductible will be out of your paycheck because thats what would be required,4
Jake Tapper, senator harris i want to bring you in here your response,4
Kamala Harris, yeah lets talk about math lets talk about math lets talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year along profited 72 billion dollars and that is on the backs of american families and under your plan status quo you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to american families in america today a diabetes patient one in four cannot afford their insulin in america today,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, for those people who have overdosed from an opioid there is a syringe that costs 4000,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, that will save their life it is immoral it is untenable,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, and it must change with medicare for all,4
Jake Tapper,  time is up senator,4
Kamala Harris, vice president biden your response,4
Joe Biden, real quick i have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices flat out number one number two we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for the nine billion opioids they sell out there they are misrepresenting the american people what need to be done and lastly heres the deal the deal is lets figure out how this works we immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they dont like no matter what one it is and,4
Joe Biden, off of their insurance plan they dont like no matter what one it is and buy into a medicare option and they can buy the gold plan and theyre not going to have to pay anyway,4
Don Lemon, thank you mr vice president thank you lets move now to immigration please,4
Don Lemon, secretary castro you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the us border illegally president obamas homeland security secretary jay johnson whom you served with says that is a public declaration that the border is effectively open to all how is he wrong,4
Julian Castro, thank you for that question you know if you elect me president youre not electing me to follow youre electing me to lead open borders is a right wing talking point and frankly im disappointed that some folks including some folks on this stage have taken the bait the only way that were going to guarantee that we dont have family separations in this country again is to repeal section 1325 of the immigration nationality act that is the law that this president this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children,4
Julian Castro, my immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who havent committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship that we do a 21st century marshall plan with honduras el salvador and guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come the united states thats how we can be smarter more effective and more humane when it comes to immigration policy,4
Don Lemon, thank you secretary castro senator bennet whats your response,4
Michael Bennet, i disagree that we should decriminalize our border this is personal for me my moms an immigrant and she was separated from her parents during the holocaust in poland for those reasons i was part of the gang of eight that wrote i wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with john mccain that passed the senate with 68 votes that gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here that would pass the most aggressive dream act that ha ever been conceived much less passed on the floor of the senate and had 46 billion dollars of border security,4
Michael Bennet, every single democrat voted for that bill,4
Don Lemon, senator,4
Michael Bennet, and a lot of republicans that should be our position,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator,4
Michael Bennet, that is our position,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator senator harris you have indicated that do you think it should be a criminal offense punishable by jail to cross the us border illegally how do you respond to senator bennet,4
Kamala Harris, well again with all due respect after the last debate for example i went to a place in florida called homestead there is a private detention facility being paid for by your tax payer dollars a private detention facility that currently houses 2700 children by the way there were members of us julian was there members of congress they would not let us enter the place members of the united states congress so i walked down the road i climbed a ladder and i looked over the fence and im going to tell you what i saw,4
Kamala Harris, i saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks the policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the book that allow them to be incarcerated as though theyve committed crimes,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, these children have not committed crimes and should be not treated like criminals,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator harris senator bennet whats your response,4
Michael Bennet, i think this is one in the end that we agree with theres not a single person on this stage who if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border,4
Michael Bennet, that is what this administration has done in the american peoples name they have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility the symbol of this country before donald trump was president was the statue of liberty that should be the symbol of the united states of america not donald trumps terrible ,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator bennet senator gillibrand im going to bring you in whats your response,4
Kirsten G., so i think when you talk about whether this should be a crime you have to remember who were talking about when i was at the texas border i visited with women who had fled violence a woman from el salvador owned a small business gangs came to her and said if you dont give us all your money were going to kill your family thats why she fled,4
Kirsten G., another woman was raped thats why she fled so this is who were talking about and theyre not criminals so i believe that we should have a civil violation no president before president trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it because hes using it as the crutch to lock up women and children to separate mothers and babies to put them behind bars so i dont think we should have a law on the books that could be so misused it should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely,4
Don Lemon, thank you senator vice president biden in the first two years of the obama administration nearly 800 thousand immigrants were deported far more than during president trumps first two years would the higher deportation rates resume if you are president,4
Joe Biden, absolutely not number one number two everything landed on the presidents desk but locusts i found that julian excuse me the secretary we sat together in many meetings i never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary,4
Crowd, three million deportations three million deportations,4
Don Lemon, please be respectful please be respectful in the crowd,4
Crowd, three million deportations,4
Don Lemon, please continue mr vice president,4
Crowd, three million deportations three million deportations three million deportations,4
Joe Biden, the fact is i dont know if you can hear i can hear but i dont know,4
Don Lemon, we can hear fine mr vice president please continue if you will,4
Joe Biden, the fact is what the senator from new york talked about is seeking asylum the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum that is not crossing the border illegally what we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly,4
Joe Biden, with regard to the secretarys point i already proposed and passed 750 million dollars for guatemala el salvador and honduras to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place in addition to that were in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the united states and make their case and if they dont that they have to wait in line,4
Joe Biden, the fact of the matter is you should be able to if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back its a crime its a crime and its not one that in fact,4
Don Lemon, thank you mr vice president secretary castro please your response,4
Julian Castro, yeah uh first of all mr vice president it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasnt let me begin by telling you,4
Julian Castro, let me just start out by answering that question my immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system because we do have a problem with that secondly the only way that were going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations dont happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law theres still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border its a civil action,4
Julian Castro, also we have 654 miles of fencing we have thousands of personnel at the border we have planes we have boats,4
Don Lemon, secretary,4
Julian Castro, we have helicopters we have security cameras,4
Don Lemon, secretary castro thank you,4
Julian Castro, what we need are politicians,4
Don Lemon, your time is up,4
Julian Castro,  that actually have some guts on this issue,4
Don Lemon, thank you secretary mr vice president please your response,4
Joe Biden, i have guts enough to say his plan doesnt make sense heres the deal the fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally it is illegal to do it unless theyre seeking asylum people should have to get in line thats the problem and the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of donald trump we should defeat donald trump and end this practice,4
Don Lemon, thank you congresswoman gabbard whats your response,4
Tulsi Gabbard, our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities whove been separated from their parents when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent inhumane conditions,4
Tulsi Gabbard, this is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies we will have to stop separating children from their parents make it so its easier for people to seek asylum in this country make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws,4
Don Lemon, mr yang your response,4
Yang, im the son of immigrants myself my father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 us patents for ge and ibm i think thats a pretty good deal for the united states thats the immigration story we need to be telling we cant always be focusing on some of the distress stories,4
Yang, and if you go to a factory here in michigan you will not find wall to wall immigrants you will find wall to wall robots and machines immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy,4
Don Lemon, thank you mr yang senator booker you have a plan that would virtually eliminate immigration detention does that mean that the roughly 55 thousand migrants currently in detention would be released into the united states,4
Cory Booker, well first of all i just want to say again tonight we are playing into republican hands who have a very different view and theyre trying to divide us against each other im listening to the language of my colleagues no mr vice president we are not going to just let people cross the border,4
Cory Booker, and unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts or if you do it through the criminal courts but the criminal courts is what is giving donald trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country who no one surrenders their human rights,4
Cory Booker, and so doing it through the civil courts means that you wont need these awful detention facilities that ive been to seeing children sleeping on pavement people being put in cages nursing mothers small children this is not necessary we have seen using the civil system piloted programs that have 100 compliance with the civil courts where people are evaluated if they have no justifiable reason to be here they are returned,4
Cory Booker, if they are like the people i met in juarez who were survivors of sexual assault who we wouldnt even let come and present for asylum we are butchering our values and making ourselves less safe,4
Don Lemon, senator booker thank you very much mr vice president your response,4
Joe Biden, i agree with the senator the asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it it has nothing to do with that section of the law thats what hes doing number one,4
Joe Biden, number two we should in fact and we have proposed and we tried to get past our administration proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come this country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people and the reason were the country we are is weve been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture immigrants built this country thats why were so special it took courage it took resilience it took absolute confidence for them to come and we should be encouraging people,4
Don Lemon, thank you,4
Joe Biden, by the way anybody who crosses the stage with a phd you should get a green card for seven years we should keep them here,4
Don Lemon, thank you thank you very much mr vice president governor inslee whats your response,4
Jay Inslee, i think were missing two central statements we need to make number one we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the white house number one,4
Jay Inslee, number two number two we have to make america what its always been a place of refuge weve got to boos the number of people we except im proud of being the first governor saying send us your syrian refugees im proud to have been the first governor to stand up against donald trumps muslim ban im proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row im ready for november 2020,4
Don Lemon, go ahead mayor de blasio please your response,4
Bill de Blasio, two points one its all kind of a charade because theres 11 million people here and everyone in theory has broken the law but theyre part of our communities now theyre part of our economy theyre our neighbors why are we even discussing on one level whether its a civil penalty or a criminal penalty when its an american reality and what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it,4
Bill de Blasio, second vice president biden i didnt hear your response when the issues came up of all those deportations you were vice president of the united states i didnt hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power your influence in the white house did you think it was a good idea or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped,4
Joe Biden, the president came along and hes the guy that came up with the idea first time ever of dealing with the dreamers he put that in the law he talked about a comprehensive plan which he lay before the congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people he said we should up the number of people that were able to bring into this country,4
Joe Biden, lastly he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place to compare him to donald trump i think is absolutely bizarre,4
Don Lemon, thank you very much mr vice president congresswoman gabbard you are a cosponsor of the college for all act which would make public colleges and universities free for all americans,4
Don Lemon, one of the authors of that plan senator sanders believes college should be tuition free for undocumented immigrants as well do you,4
Tulsi Gabbard, i dont i think its important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as theyve been living in the shadows and instead of putting a bandaid on this problem fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenship so that they are no longer treated as second class citizens in this country,4
Tulsi Gabbard, weve got to look at the challenge that people all across this country are facing under crushing student debt this is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and i believe that it is our generation that has the bold creative solutions to be able to solve it this is about promise for our future and weve got to make those kinds of investments,4
Don Lemon, thank you congresswoman mayor de blasio whats your response,4
Bill de Blasio, yeah i agree with the congress member but i dont hear an answer from the vice president im confused i asked the vice president point blank did he use his power to stop those deportations he went right around the question mr vice president you want to be president of the united states you need to be able to answer the tough questions i guarantee you if youre debating donald trump hes not going to let you off the hook,4
Bill de Blasio, so did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake we shouldnt do it which one,4
Joe Biden, i was vice president i am not the president i keep my recommendations to him in private unlike you i expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him thats not what i do,4
Joe Biden, what i do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system thats what he did thats what he did but much more has to be done much more has to be done,4
Bill de Blasio, i still dont hear an answer,4
Don Lemon, senator booker please respond,4
Cory Booker, well a couple things first of all mr vice president you cant have it both ways you invoke president obama more than anybody in this campaign you cant do it when its convenient and then dodge it when its not,4
Cory Booker, and the second thing and this really irks me because i heard the vice president say that if youve got a phd you can come right into this country well thats playing into what the republicans want to pit some immigrants against other immigrants some are from shit hole countries and some are from worthy countries,4
Cory Booker, we need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone dont let the republicans divide this party against itself,4
Don Lemon, senator thank you mr vice president your response,4
Joe Biden, the fact is thats what i said about this country we are a country of immigrants all of us all of us some here came against their will others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives and they did the  thats what were talking about thats what made us great and the fact of the matter is i think the president of the united states barack obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly,4
Don Lemon, senator gillibrand whats your response,4
Kirsten G., again president trump under his administration seven children died in his custody under his administration families have been torn apart this party is talking about real ideas for the future were talking about what we will do to change america but we must not forget about our values,4
Kirsten G., we used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated we used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us lets remind the american people who we are why we are democrats and why were running for president ,4
Don Lemon, senator gillibrand thank you very much the debate will be right back right after this short break,4
Jake Tapper, welcome back to the cnn democratic presidential debate we are live from detroit i want to turn now to criminal justice mr vice president senator booker called your new criminal justice reform plan an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country why is senator booker wrong,4
Joe Biden, well i dont  i think he is wrong i think we should work together he has a similar plan i think that we should change the way we look at prisons right now were in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime they end up going to jail and to prison they should be going to rehabilitation they shouldnt be going to prison,4
Joe Biden, when in prison they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals and when they get out of prison they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they wouldve had before including pell grants for education including making sure that theyre able to have housing public housing including they have all the opportunities that were available them because we want them to become better citizens thats the essence of what my plan in detail lays out,4
Joe Biden, im happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator want to and so i looked at it  anyway thats what i think my plan  i know what my plan does and i think its not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done its a,4
Jake Tapper, senator your response,4
Cory Booker, well my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty mental health and addiction with locking people up and not lifting them up and mr vice president has said that since the 1970s every major crime bill every crime bill major and minor has had his name on it and so those are your words not mine and this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws and you cant just now come out with a plan to put out that fire,4
Cory Booker, we have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform like having,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Cory Booker,  true marijuana justice which means that,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator booker,4
Cory Booker,  we legalize it on a federal level,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator booker,4
Cory Booker,  and reinvest the profits in communities,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator booker,4
Cory Booker,  that have been disproportionately targeted by marijuana enforcement,4
Jake Tapper, vice president biden vice president biden i want to give you a chance to respond,4
Joe Biden, the fact is that the bills that the president that  excuse me the future president here that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelmingly,4
Joe Biden, since 2007 i for example tried to get the crack powder cocaine totally  disparity totally eliminated in 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was  you went out and you hired rudy giulianis guy you engaged in stop and frisk you had 75 of those stops reviewed as illegal you found yourself in this situation with three times as many africanamerican kids were caught in that chain and caught up the justice department came after you for saying you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate and then in fact and nothing happened the entire time you were mayor,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator booker you want to respond,4
Cory Booker, well first of all im grateful that he endorsed my presidency already but ill tell you this its no secret that i inherited a criminal  a police department with massive problems and decadeslong challenges but the head of the aclu has already said the head of the new jersey aclu that i put forth national standards setting accountability mr vice president,4
Joe Biden, at that point,4
Cory Booker, mr vice president i didnt interrupt you,4
Joe Biden, ,4
Cory Booker, please show me that respect sir we have a system right now thats broken and if you want to compare records and frankly im shocked that you do i am happy to do that because all the problems that he is talking about that he created i actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you are frankly to correct you mr vice president you are bragging calling it the biden crime bill up until 2015,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator vice president biden,4
Joe Biden, number one the bill he talks about is a bill that in my  our administration we passed we passed that bill that you added onto thats the bill in fact you passed and the fact of the matter is secondly there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was trouble why did you announce in the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire rudy giulianis guy in 2007 when i was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine ,4
Cory Booker, mr vice president theres a saying in my community youre dipping into the koolaid and you dont even know the flavor,4
Cory Booker, you need to come to the city of newark and see the reforms that we put in place the new jersey head of the aclu has said that i embraced reforms not just in action but in deed sir you are trying to shift the view from what you created,4
Cory Booker, there are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroy communities like mine this isnt about the past sir this is about the present right now,4
Cory Booker, i believe in redemption,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Cory Booker, im happy you evolved,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in secretary,4
Cory Booker,  but you offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in secretary castro your response sir,4
Julian Castro, i agree with senator booker that a lot of what vice president helped author in 94 was a mistake and he has flip flopped on these things and thats clear but let me say when we talk about criminal justice reform there are a lot of things that we can talk about sentencing reform cash bail reform investing in public defenders diversion programs im proud that im the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it and whether its the case of someone like tamir rice or michael brown or eric garner where the trump justice department just decided not to pursue charges we do ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force,4
Jake Tapper, thank you secretary castro,4
Jay Inslee, ,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in governor inslee governor inslee your response,4
Jay Inslee, let me suggest that people come out to the state of washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like our effort to reduce racial disparity im proud that i was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes now were vacating more tens of thousands weve eliminated the death penalty and importantly weve done this when people come out of the legal system and theyve done their responsibility to the citizens we need to make sure they can get a job we have ban the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out,4
Jay Inslee, and ive got to argue with my friend secretary castro we havent just put forward a plan we have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and train our police officers in deescalation techniques so we have less violence ,4
Jake Tapper, secretary castro your response to governor inslee,4
Julian Castro, well that its much more than that because what we see and this was a good example the other day of the department of justice not going after officer pantaleo that  officer pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by nypd he did that for seven seconds 11 different times eric garner said that he couldnt breathe he knew what he was doing that he was killing eric garner and yet he has not been brought to justice that police officer should be off the street,4
Jake Tapper, mayor de blasio mayor de blasio why is that police officer still on the force the one who killed eric gardner please respond,4
Bill de Blasio, let me tell you i know the garner family theyve gone through extraordinary pain they are waiting for justice and theyre going to get justice theres finally going to be justice i have confidence in that in the next 30 days in new york you know why because for the first time we are not waiting on the federal justice department which told the city of new york that we could not proceed because the justice department was pursuing their prosecution and years went by and a lot of pain accrued,4
Bill de Blasio, and in the meantime what im working on is making sure and i have for five years there will never be another tragedy theyll never be another eric garner because were changing fundamentally how we police,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, but theres one last point i have to say about the justice department the vice president for two and a half of those years mr vice president tell us what did you do to try and spur on the justice department,4
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you mayor,4
Bill de Blasio,  to act in the garner case,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mayor de blasio vice president biden you can respond to that,4
Joe Biden, we did a lot number one we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38000 people number one number two we in fact insisted that we change the rules of police engaging they had to have  we provided for body cameras we made sure that there were a lot of things that were changed in the process but 38000 people in the federal system were released under the system,4
Joe Biden, and so the fact is that theres a lot weve done but heres the deal the fact is that were talking about things that occurred a long long time ago and now all of a sudden i find it fascinating everybodys talking about how terrible i am on these issues barack obama knew exactly who i was he had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties and he chose me and he said it was the best decision he made,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr vice president,4
Joe Biden, ,4
Jake Tapper, mr yang your response,4
Andrew Yang, i speak for just about everyone watching when i say i would trust anyone on this stage much more than i would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice we cannot tear each other down we have to focus on beating donald trump in 2020,4
Andrew Yang, i want to share a story that a prison guard a corrections officer in new hampshire said to me he said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when theyre behind bars right now we think were saving money we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways we should put money directly into peoples hands certainly when they come out of prison but before they go into prison,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr yang i want to bring in senator gillibrand you heard earlier mayor de blasio respond to secretary castro on the question of why the police officer who killed eric gardner is still on the nypd was that response adequate please respond,4
Kirsten G., no he should be fired he should be fired now i sat down with eric garners mother and i can tell you when youve lost your son when he begged for breath when you know because you have a video when you know he said i cant breathe so many times over and over again when you know he used an illegal chokehold that person should be fired if i was the mayor id fire him but as president i would make sure that we had a full investigation that the report would be made public and if i wasnt satisfied we would have a consent decree,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in senator harris now senator harris you have also been quite,4
Jake Tapper, senator harris now senator harris you have also been quite critical of vice president bidens policies on race specifically on the issue of busing in the 1970s having benefited from busing when you were a young child vice president biden says that your current position on busing youre opposed to federally mandated busing that that position is the same as his position is he right,4
Kamala Harris, that is simply false and lets be very clear about this when vice president biden was in the united states senate working with segregationist to oppose busing which was the vehicle by which we would integrate americas public schools had i been in the united states senate at that time i would have been completely on the other side of the aisle and lets be clear about this had those segregationists their way i would not be a member of the united states senate cory booker would not be a member of the united states senate and barack obama would not have been in a position to nominate him for the title he now holds,4
Kamala Harris, and so on that issue we could not be more apart which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time now i would like to also talk about this conversation about eric garner because i too met with his mother and one of the things that weve got to be clear about is that this president of the united states donald trump while he has been in office has quietly been allowing the united states department of justice to shut down consent decrees to stop pattern and practice investigations on that case,4
Kamala Harris, we also know that the  will reign and there will be independent investigations,4
Jake Tapper, vice president biden i want to give you a chance to respond to what senator harris just said,4
Joe Biden, when senator harris was the attorney general for eight years in the state of california there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country in los angeles and in san francisco and she did not i didnt see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them,4
Joe Biden, secondly she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing peoples rights and the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that you in fact have been the police officer did something that did not give you information that would explicate your client she didnt do that she never did it and so what happened along came a federal judge and said enough enough and he freed  a thousand of these people if you doubt me google a thousand prisoners freed kamala harris,4
Jake Tapper, thank you vice president biden and senator harris your response,4
Kamala Harris, that is simply not true and as attorney general of california where i ran the second largest department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice i am proud of the work we did work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the united states senate for decades,4
Kamala Harris, it was the work of creating one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, i did the work as attorney general of putting body cameras,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, on special agents  in the state of california and im proud of that work,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring in congresswoman gabbard congresswoman gabbard you took issue with senator harris confronting vice president biden at the last debate you called it a quote false accusation that joe biden is a racist whats your response,4
Tulsi Gabbard, i want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today,4
Tulsi Gabbard, oh senator harris says shes proud of her record as a prosecutor and that shell be a prosecutor president but im deeply concerned about this record there are too many examples to cite but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,4
Tulsi Gabbard, she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so she kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of california and she fought to keep  cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way,4
Jake Tapper, thank you congresswoman senator harris your response,4
Kamala Harris, as the elected attorney general of california i did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people which became a national model for the work that needs to be done and i am proud of that work and i am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that i had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform,4
Kamala Harris, that is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Kamala Harris, it is why and because i know that criminal justice system is so broken,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, that i am an advocate for what  but legalize marijuana in the united states,4
Jake Tapper, i want to bring a congresswoman gabbard back in your response,4
Tulsi Gabbard, the bottom line is senator harris when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these peoples lives you did not and worse yet in the case of those who were on death row innocent people you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so there is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor you owe them an apology,4
Jake Tapper, senator harris,4
Kamala Harris, my entire career i have been,4
Kamala Harris, adopt a green new deal on day one as president,4
Speaker 1, thank you,4
Kamala Harris, i would reenter us in the paris agreement,4
Speaker 1, thank you senator,4
Kamala Harris, and put in place so we would be carbon neutral by 2030,4
Speaker 1, thank you senator i want to talk about that with senator  includes the guarantee of a job with medical leave paid vacations and retirement security for everyone in america explain how thats realistic,4
Kristen Gillibr, so the first thing that im going to do when im president is im going to clorox the oval office the second thing im going to do is i will reengage on global climate change and i will not only sign the paris global climate accords but i will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis,4
Kristen Gillibr, the greatest threat to humanity is global climate change i visited a family in iowa who water spewed into her home fran par it tossed her refrigerator upend all the furniture was broken all the dishes were broken and mud was everywhere that is the impact of severe weather right now on families lives,4
Kristen Gillibr, and so the truth is we need a robust solution when john f kennedy said i want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years not because its easy but because its hard he knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation our success our ability to galvanize worldwide competition he wanted to have a space race with russia why not have a green energy race with china why not have clean air and clean water for all americans why not rebuild our infrastructure why not actually invest in the green jobs thats what the green new deal is about,4
Speaker 1, thank you,4
Kristen Gillibr, not only will i pass it but i will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us,4
Speaker 1, thank you senator congresswoman gabbard you are not a cosponsor of the green new deal please respond,4
Tulsi Gabbard, oh first of all this is personal you can imagine i grew up in hawaii which is the most remote island chain in the world so for us growing up there protecting our environment was not a political issue its a way of life its part of our culture its part of who we are this is why as a member of congress long before there was ever a green new deal i introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in congress called the off fossil fuels act that actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy invest in workforce training invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today,4
Speaker 1, thank you congresswoman senator booker whats your response is the job guarantee in the green new deal realistic,4
Cory Booker, i just want to take first of all a step back and say that i agree wholeheartedly with governor inslee and its one of the reasons why greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field  i want to say very clearly thank you man thank you ill try harder look the reason why is because first of all this problem didnt start yesterday science didnt become a reality yesterday this has been going on for years there was another president that would not join an international accord then it was the kyoto accord i was mayor then and i stood up in national leadership joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue,4
Cory Booker, it must be the issue and the lens with which you view every issue nobody should get applause for rejoining the paris climate accords that is kindergarten we have to go to far advance and makes sure that everything from our trade deals everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential which is dealing with the climate threat and yes the majority of this problem is outside the united states but the only way were going to deal with this,4
Speaker 1, thank you,4
Cory Booker, is that the united states leads,4
Kamala Harris, thank you senator mayor de blasio your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in new york city public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead as you know were not far from flint michigan where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water how can you assure the people of flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem,4
Bill de Blasio, we have a huge problem and its decades old in new york but heres what weve done about it weve declared the eradication of all lead literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and for all as the goal of our administration and were doing something about it lead poisoning has gone down 90 since 2005 and were going to literally bring it down to zero because were going to go into every place buildings schools public housing and take out that lead remediate that lead once and for all and that needs to be done all over this country now the federal government used to not take any responsibility for,4
Bill de Blasio,  country now the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing for decades theyve been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility thats part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with but ill tell you what you do when youre actually in charge of something im in charge of the largest city in this nation you do not accept the status quo you fix it and so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all and there should be a federal mandate to do the same for flint for detroit for every place in this country it can be done,4
Moderator, thank you mister mayor secretary castro why are you the right candidate to solve this problem please respond,4
Julian Castro, well because people dont have to wonder what i would do ive actually done it i was secretary of housing and urban development when flint had its water crisis i went to flint we did what we could to help folks get water filters and then we didnt stop there we improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children a lot of americans dont know that this is still a major problem out there i was back in flint about six weeks ago and i released a plan to invest 50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat we need to do it we can do it and i will do it,4
Jake Tapper, thank you secretary castro,4
Speaker 2, may i get in this,4
Jake Tapper, donald trump won independents here in michigan by 16 percentage points which was critical to donald trump winning the states 16 electoral votes now there is a big debate within the democratic party here and around the country about the best way the democrats can win back michigan vice president biden last night on this stage senator elizabeth warren said quote were not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness were going to solve them by being the democratic party of big structural change what do you say to progressives who worry that your proposals are not ambitious enough to energize the progressive wing of your party which you will need to beat donald trump,4
Joe Biden, because we did it i was asked to manage an 87 billion plan to be spent in a total of 18 months that revived this state and many others and it kept us out of a depression with twotenths of 1 of waste or fraud secondly i was part of the organization within our administration that pushed bailing general motors out saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state number three number three i also was asked as the mayor of detroit can tell you by the president of the united states to help detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet i spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that we invested significantly in this city in transportation anyway the point is weve made significant investments in this state i expect in this city i expect thats why the mayor endorsed me,4
Jake Tapper, thank you vice president biden senator gillibrand whats your response,4
Kirsten G., to the people of michigan i know exactly how id beat president trump ive already done it i took a bus tour to talk about trumps broken promises here in michigan he promised no bad trade deals not only did he not have bad trade deals he started a trade war with china and he just signed onto another bad trade agreement with nafta 20 a giveaway to drug companies in mexico i took the bus to michigan to ohio and to pennsylvania telling people that he has broken his promises to them i lifted up their voices i listened to their concerns and i offered real solutions and ive done this before my first house district i ran in was a twotoone republican district i won it twice and i havent lost an election since so i can bring people together in red purple and blue areas but more than that i can get things done,4
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you senator gillibrand mr yang in poll after poll democratic voters say that having a nominee who can beat president trump is more important to them than having a nominee who agrees with them on major issues and right now according to polls they say the candidate who has the best chance of doing that of beating president trump is vice president biden why are they wrong,4
Andrew Yang, well im building a coalition of disaffected trump voters independents libertarians and conservatives as well as democrats and progressives i believe im the candidate best suited to beat donald trump and as for how to win in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind what we have to do is we have to say look there is record high gdp and stock market prices you know what else are at record highs suicides drug overdoses depression anxiety its gotten so bad that american life expectancy has declined for the last three years,4
Andrew Yang, and i like to talk about my wife whos at home with our two boys right now one of whom is autistic what does her work count at in todays economy zero and we know thats the opposite of the truth we know that her work is among the most challenging and vital the way we win this election is we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in michigan and all of us like our own health our wellbeing our mental health our clean air and clean water how our kids are doing if we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own wellbeing then we will win this election,4
Jake Tapper, thank you mr yang congresswoman gabbard your response,4
Tulsi Gabbard, donald trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like theyve been left behind by both political parties by selfserving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people im speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in flint michigan are still being left behind still being poisoned by the water in their system because every single month we are spending 4 billion on a continuing war in afghanistan 4 billion every single month rather than ending that war bringing our troops home and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country people and communities like flint thats the kind of leadership that ill bring,4
Jake Tapper, thank you congresswoman senator booker your response,4
Cory Booker, im grateful im grateful jake look this is one of those times where were not staring at the truth and calling it out and this is a case for the democratic party the truth will set us free we lost the state of michigan because everybody from republicans to russians were targeting the suppression of african american voters we need to say that if the african american vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier we would have won the state of michigan we need to have a campaign that is ready for whats coming an allout assault especially on the most valuable voter group in our in fact the highestperforming voter group in our coalition which is black women and so i will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression that can activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions that are going to win states like michigan and pennsylvania and wisconsin,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator harris,4
Kamala Harris, first of all donald trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep he said he was going to help farmers he said he was going to help auto workers farmers are now looking at bankruptcy soybeans rotting in bales auto workers we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year jerome powell just dropped the interest rates and he admitted why because of this socalled trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the trump trade tax that has resulted in american families spending as much as 14 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines he betrayed the american people he betrayed american families and he will lose this election because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up and thats what we want in the next president of the united states,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator harris the debate is back right,4
Dana Bash, and were back with the cnn democratic presidential debate we want to turn now to the economy secretary castro this was for you rising unemployment is near historic lows including for latinos and african americans you have all outlined plans but you in particular that could end up raising taxes how can you guarantee that wont hurt the economy,4
Julian Castro, well first of all there are a lot of americans right now that are hurting just go and ask the folks that just received notice that theyre going to get been laid off by general motors or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the united states or ask fast food workers that i joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and cant provide for their families or pay the rent so the idea that america is doing just fine is wrong not only that this president always likes to take credit like he did this weve now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth the longest streak in american history over 80 months of that was due to president barack obama thank you barack obama thank you barack obama so i believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that americans can prosper in the years to come making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they dont have to worry about going homeless because they cant afford a medical procedure,4
Dana Bash, thank you secretary castro i want to turn now to a question about trade and for congresswoman gabbard many saw the transpacific partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of china you were against it how would you ensure that the united states is able to remain competitive against china on the world stage,4
Tulsi Gabbard, by pushing for fair trade not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the american people and our country that give away american jobs and that threaten our environment these were the three main issues with that massive trade deal the transpacific partnership i think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass either a federal law or a state or a local law this is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country what to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment these are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy,4
Dana Bash, so to be clear congresswoman would you keep president trumps tariffs on china in place,4
Tulsi Gabbard, i would not because the approach that president trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers on our farmers who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that trump has taken,4
Dana Bash, vice president biden would you read join the transpacific partnership which of course president trump withdrew from please respond,4
Joe Biden, id renegotiate it we make up 25 of the worlds economy in order either chinas going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are we have to join with the 40 of the world that we had with us and this time makes sure that theres no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there and to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now in the things that make them more competitive thats what we have to do otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road we must have the rest of the world join us to keep them,4
Dana Bash, thank you,4
Joe Biden,  in check from abusing it,4
Dana Bash, thank you vice president biden just to be clear would you or would you not rejoin the ttp yes or no,4
Joe Biden, i would not rejoin the ttp as it was initially put forward i would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the pacific nations that we had in south america and north america so that we could bring them together to hold china accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted otherwise theyre going to do exactly what theyre doing fill the vacuum and run the table,4
Dana Bash, thank you sir mayor de blasio you also oppose the deal please respond,4
Bill de Blasio, yeah and i would just want to ask this question of all the candidates but particularly of vice president biden president trump is trying to sell nafta 20 hes got a new name for it its just as dangerous as the old nafta its going to take away american jobs like the old nafta like it did to michigan and we cannot have democrats be party to a new nafta so vice president i believe youre the only person on the stage who voted for the original nafta are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new nafta and that what you will believe in which a lot of us hope for is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again not just multinational corporations,4
Dana Bash, mr vice president,4
Joe Biden, yes,4
Dana Bash, your response your response sir,4
Joe Biden, yes,4
Dana Bash, thats it,4
Joe Biden, no he said would i insist that labor be engaged the answer is yes,4
Bill de Blasio, i consider that a victory,4
Joe Biden, well i love your affection for me you spend a lot of time with me,4
Bill de Blasio, you know what we believe in redemption joe we believe in redemption in this party,4
Joe Biden, well i tell you what i hope youre part of it,4
Dana Bash, okay i want to ask a question of senator bennett now senator cnn reached out to michigan democratic primary voters for their most pressing question ferris from flint michigan has this question here in detroit our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security how would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy,4
Michael Bennet, dana this goes to the last question you asked as well which is how are we going to remain competitive its not just about trade which we were talking about earlier its about whether were going to invest in this country anymore since 2001 we have cut five trillion dollars worth of taxes almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in america we have made the income inequality worse not better through the policies of the federal government weve spent 56 trillion dollars in the middle east thats 12 or 13 trillion dollars that from the point of view of driving the economy in michigan or anywhere else in america we might as well just have lit that money on fire weve got to stop doing that and we need to invest in america again for the money that weve spent that i just described we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country we could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed we could have fixed not just flint but every,4
Dana Bash, thank you,4
Michael Bennet,  water system in this country we couldve made social security solvent for my children,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator,4
Michael Bennet, but we did none of it because of selfserving politicians in washington dc who voted for deals that were good for them,4
Dana Bash, senator bennett thank you very much,4
Michael Bennet, but not for michigan or the american people,4
Dana Bash, your time is up sir mr yang mr yang women on average earn 80 cents about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men senator harris wants to fine companies that dont close their gender pay gaps as an entrepreneur do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees,4
Andrew Yang, i have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned particularly in startups and entrepreneurship we have to do more at every step and if you are a woman entrepreneur the obstacles start not just at home but then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they dont look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one in order to give women a leg up what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country im talking about the waitress whos getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea but right now is stuck where she is what we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses and the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of 1000 a month into their hands it would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society it will not change unless we change it and i say thats just what we do,4
Dana Bash, senator harris your response,4
Kamala Harris, i think that supported my proposal which is this since 1963 when we passed the equal pay act we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work fast forward to the year of our lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar black women 61 cents native american woman 58 cents latinas 53 cents im done with the conversation so yes i am proposing in order to deal with this one im going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work two they will be fined for every 1 differential between what theyre paying men and women they will be find 1 of their previous years profits thatll get everybodys attention,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator senator,4
Kamala Harris, time for action,4
Dana Bash, senator gillibrand whats your response will fining companies help solve the problem,4
Gillibrand, i think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace and i want to address vice president biden directly when the senate was debating middleclass affordability for childcare he wrote an oped he voted against it the only vote but what he wrote an oped was that he believed that women working outside the home would create the deterioration of family he also said that women who were working outside the home were avoiding responsibility and i just need to understand as a woman whos worked my entire career as the primarywage earner as the primary caregiver in fact my second son henry is here and i had him when i was a member of congress so under vice president bidens analysis am i serving in congress resulting in the deterioration of the family because i had access to quality affordable daycare i just want to know what he meant when he said that,4
Joe Biden, that was a long time ago and heres what it was about it would have given people making today 100000 a year a tax break for childcare i did not want that i wanted the childcare to go to people making less than 100000 and thats what it was about as a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself i have some idea what it costs i support making sure that every single solitary person needing child care get an 8000 tax credit now that would put 700000 women back to work increase the gdp by almost eighttenths of 1 its the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things why cant we do it this way,4
Dana Bash, thank you,4
Gillibrand, but mr vice president you didnt answer my question what did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home its resulting in the deterioration of family,4
Joe Biden, no what i,4
Gillibrand, and that we are avoiding these are quotes it was the title of the oped,4
Joe Biden, no,4
Gillibrand, and that just causes concern for me because we know americas women are working four out of 10 moms have to work they are the primary or sole wage earners they actually have to put food on the table eight out of 10 moms are working today most women have to work to provide for their kids many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator let the vice president respond now thank you,4
Gillibrand, either you dont believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then,4
Joe Biden, in the very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children my present wife has worked all the way through raising our children the fact of the matter is the situation is one that i dont know whats happened i wrote the violence against women act lilly ledbetter i was deeply involved in making sure theres the equal pay amendments i was deeply involved in all these things i came up with the its on us proposal to see to it the women were treated more decently on college campuses you came to syracuse university with me and said it was wonderful im passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally i dont know whats happened except that youre now running for president,4
Gillibrand, so i understand mr vice president mr vice president i respect you deeply i respect you deeply but those words are very specific you said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family my grandmother worked outside the home,4
Joe Biden, so did,4
Gillibrand, my mother worked outside the home,4
Joe Biden, thats,4
Gillibrand, and for,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator gillibrand,4
Gillibrand, well he hasnt either,4
Dana Bash, i want to bring senator harris into this conversation,4
Gillibrand, either he no longer believes it i mean i just think he needs to,4
Joe Biden, i never believed it,4
Gillibrand, okay,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator harris please respond,4
Kamala Harris, well i just listen i mean talk about now running for president and you change your position on the hyde amendment vice president where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that because youve only since youve been running for president this time said that you in some way would take that back or you didnt agree with the decision that you made over many many years,4
Joe Biden, im getting to,4
Kamala Harris, and this directly impacted so many women in our country and i personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases and the experience that those women have those children have and that they would then be denied the resources,4
Dana Bash, thank you senator let the vice president respond to it,4
Kamala Harris, i think is unacceptable,4
Joe Biden, the fact is that the senator knows thats not my position everybody on this stage whos been in the congress and the senate or house has voted for the hyde amendment at some point the hyde amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately but once i wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact have an opportunity to have health care paid for by the federal government everyone that that could no longer stand i support a womans right to choose i support it its a constitutional right ive supported it and i will continue to support it and i will in fact move as president to see to that the congress legislates that that is the law as well,4
Dana Bash, thank you thank you mr vice president governor inslee your response,4
Kamala Harris, well why did it take you so long to change your position on the hyde amendment why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the hyde amendment,4
Joe Biden, because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point,4
Kamala Harris, okay,4
Dana Bash, thank you governor inslee your response,4
Jay Inslee, i would suggest that we need to broaden our discussion i would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in america which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority they have been almost always underpaid and that is why this year im proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the united states and i believe that that is long long overdue i think it is true for nursing staff as well and im glad that weve now passed new measures,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Jay Inslee, and im glad that weve increased our union membership 10,4
Jake Tapper, thank you governor,4
Jay Inslee, so unions can stand up for women as well,4
Jake Tapper, thank you governor inslee i want to turn to foreign policy if we can senator booker there are about 14000 us service members in afghanistan right now if elected will they still be in afghanistan by the end of your first year in office,4
Cory Booker, well first of all i want to say very clearly that i will not do foreign policy by tweet as donald trump seems to do all the time a guy that literally tweets out that were pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like afghanistan and so i will bring our troops home and i will bring them home as quickly as possible but i will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline i will make sure we do it we do it expeditiously we do it safely to not create a vacuum thats ultimately going to destabilize the middle east and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation,4
Jake Tapper, congresswoman gabbard youre the only veteran on the stage please respond,4
Tulsi Gabbard, this is real in a way thats very difficult to convey in words i was deployed to iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where i served in a field medical unit where every single day i saw the high cost of war just this past week two more of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan my cousin is deployed to afghanistan right now nearly 300 of our hawaii national guard soldiers are deployed to afghanistan 14000 service members are deployed there this is not about arbitrary deadlines this is about leadership the leadership i will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home within the first year in office because they shouldnt have been there this long for too long weve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll that it takes on our service members on their families we have to do the right thing end these wasteful regimechange wars and bring our troops home,4
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you congresswoman mr yang iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after president trump withdrew the us from the deal and that puts iran closer to building a nuclear weapon the ability to do so at the very least youve said if iran violates the agreement the us would need to respond very strongly so how would a president yang respond right now,4
Andrew Yang, i would move to deescalate tensions in iran because theyre responding to the fact that weve pulled out of this agreement and it wasnt just us and iran there were many other world powers that were part of that multilateral agreement wed have to try and reenter that agreement renegotiate the timelines because the timelines now dont make as much sense but ive signed a pledge to end the forever wars right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home whats happened really weve fallen apart at home so we elected donald trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies what we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problem right here at home weve spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of american lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits weve been in a constant state of war for 18 years this is not what the american people want i would bring the troops home i would deescalate tensions with iran and i would start investing our resources in our own communities,4
Jake Tapper, governor inslee your response,4
Jay Inslee, well i think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment and there is no sort of primer for presidents to read we have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions i was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the iraq war i was a relatively new member of congress and i made the right judgment because it was obvious to me that george bush was fanning the flames of war now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president whod be willing to beat the drums of war we need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions that was the right vote and i believe it,4
Jake Tapper, thank you thank you governor vice president biden he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in iraq as a us senator,4
Joe Biden, i did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the un to agree to put inspectors in from the moment shock and awe started from that moment i was opposed to the effort and i was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the congress and the administration secondly i was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on iraq he turned and said joe get our combat troops out in front of the entire national security team one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in alfaw palace and tell everyone that were coming all our combat troops are coming home,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Joe Biden, i opposed the surge in afghanistan this is long overdue we should have not in fact gone into afghanistan,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Joe Biden,  the way,4
Bill de Blasio, mr vice president,4
Joe Biden, thank you mr vice president i want to bring in,4
Joe Biden, i would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in iraq governor im sorry congresswoman gabbard your response to what vice president biden just said,4
Tulsi Gabbard, we were all lied to this is the betrayal this is the betrayal to the american people to me to my fellow service members we were all lied to told that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction was working with alqaeda and that this posed a threat to the american people so i enlisted after 911 to protect our country to go after those who attacked us on that fateful day who took the lives of thousands of americans the problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us we were supposed to be going after alqaeda but over years now not only have we not gone after alqaeda who is stronger today than they were in 911 our president is supporting alqaeda,4
Jake Tapper, thank you congresswoman,4
Bill de Blasio, we still didnt talk about iran,4
Jake Tapper, thank you please,4
Bill de Blasio, we didnt talk about iran,4
Jake Tapper, please,4
Bill de Blasio, because were on the march to war in iran right now and we blew by it,4
Jake Tapper, please mayor the rules please follow the rules,4
Bill de Blasio, i respect the rules,4
Jake Tapper, mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, but we,4
Jake Tapper, mayor,4
Bill de Blasio, have to stop this,4
Jake Tapper, mayor thank you very much,4
Bill de Blasio,  march to war in iran,4
Jake Tapper, were going on and were going to talk about another subject,4
Bill de Blasio, and the democratic party has to stand up for it,4
Jake Tapper, mayor thank you very much i appreciate that lets talk about now the former special counsel robert muellers appearance in front of congress last week when asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office his answer was yes senator harris youve criticized president trump for interfering with the justice department and just last month you said if you were elected president your justice department would have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former president trump why is it okay for you to advocate for the justice department to prosecute somebody but president trump not him,4
Kamala Harris, well i would never direct the department of justice to do whatever it believes it should do but listen look we all watched his testimony i read the report there are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable ive seen people go to prison for far less and the reality of it is that we have a person in the white house right now who has been shielded by a memo in the united states department of justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted i believe the american people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law including the president of the united states,4
Jake Tapper, senator booker your response,4
Cory Booker, my response is exactly that ive read the report ive read the redacted versions of the report we have something that is astonishing going on the united states of america we have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world hes acting like an authoritarian against the actual constitution that he swore an oath to uphold and so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage i believe that we in the united states congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately and ill tell you this debbie stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings because he is now stonewalling congress not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances we swore an oath to uphold the constitution the politics of this be damned when we look back in history at what happened when a president of the united states started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world the question is what will we have done and i believe the congress should do its job,4
Jake Tapper, senator booker thank you very much secretary castro whats your response,4
Julian Castro, well i agree i was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings there are 10 different instances that robert mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice and i believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings as to the question of what my department of justice would do i agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute however i believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that youre likely to see a prosecution of donald trump,4
Jake Tapper, thank you secretary mayor de blasio im going to bring you in whats your response,4
Bill de Blasio, i think its obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment but i want to caution my fellow democrats while we move in every way we can for impeachment we have to remember at the same time the american people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives and what they see when they turn on the tv or go online is just talk about impeachment we need more talk about working people and their lives for example are we really ready and i ask people on this stage this question are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes thats something every american wants to know about thats something they want answers to right now so yeah move for impeachment but dont forget to do the peoples business and to stand up for working people because thats how were actually going to beat donald trump the best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020,4
Jake Tapper, mayor thank you very much senator bennett how do you respond to this conversation,4
Michael Bennet, i think look as we go forward here we need to recognize a very practical reality which is that we are four months away weve got the august recess then we are four months away from the iowa caucuses and i just want to make sure whatever we do doesnt end up with an acquittal by mitch mcconnell in the senate which it surely would and then president trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the united states congress i believe we have a moral obligation to beat donald trump he has to be a singleterm president and we cant do anything that plays into his hands we were talking earlier about climate up here its so important donald trump should be the last climate denier thats ever in the white house,4
Jake Tapper, senator bennet thank you very much secretary castro please respond,4
Michael Bennet, but we need to be smart about how,4
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,4
Michael Bennet,  were running or were going to give him a second term,4
Jake Tapper, secretary please your turn,4
Michael Bennet, we cant do it,4
Julian Castro, well let me first say that i really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time all of us have a vision for the future of the country that were articulating to the american people were going to continue to do that we have an election coming up at the same time senator i think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress had been spooked by 1998 i believe that the times are different and in fact i think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment the mueller report clearly details that he deserves it and whats going to happen in the fall of next year of 2020 if they dont impeach him its easy to say you see you see the democrats didnt go after me on impeachment and you know why because i didnt do anything wrong these folks that always investigate me theyre always trying to go after me when it came down to it they didnt go after me there because i didnt do anything wrong conversely if mitch mcconnell is the one that lets him off the hook were going to be able to say,4
Jake Tapper, secretary,4
Julian Castro, well sure they impeached him in the house,4
Jake Tapper, secretary castro thank you,4
Julian Castro,  but his friend mitch mcconnell moscow mitch,4
Jake Tapper, thank you secretary,4
Julian Castro,  let him off the hook,4
Jake Tapper, senator bennet please respond,4
Michael Bennet, i dont disagree with that you just said it better than i did we have to walk and chew gum at the same time it is incredibly unusual for members of congress to be able to do that and im glad that secretary castro has the ambition,4
Julian Castro, well my brother can hes here tonight,4
Michael Bennet, thats what i was going to say its your brother thats giving you that good feeling about the congress thats what we should do,4
Jake Tapper, thank you,4
Speaker 1, welcome back to the cnn the democratic presidential debate it is time now for closing statements you will each receive one minute mayor de blasio lets begin with you,4
Bill de Blasio, thank you for the last three years weve watched donald trump pit working people against each other black versus white citizen versus immigrant and why so that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the american dream hostage from everyone else we cant let them get away with it if were going to beat donald trump this has to be a party that stands for something,4
Bill de Blasio, this has to be the party of labor unions this has to be the party of universal health care this has to be the party thats not afraid to say out loud were going to tax the hell out of the wealthy and when we do that donald trump right on cue will call us socialists well heres what ill say to him donald youre the real socialist the problem is its socialism for the rich,4
Bill de Blasio, we here in this country we dont have to take that anymore we can fight back if you agree that we can stand up to donald trump and we can stand up to the wealthy then go to taxthehellcom and join us so we can build a country that puts working people first,4
Speaker 1, senator bennet,4
Senator Bennet, thank you thank you very much what i want to say to all of you tonight is we have been here before as a country we have faced challenges that weve actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought how hard they work how hard they organized the votes they had to take the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic more fair and more free and now we have a person in the white house who has no appreciation of that history who doesnt believe in the rule of law who doesnt believe in the independence of the judiciary who doesnt believe that climate change is real,4
Senator Bennet, i think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us all of us to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face but the only way were going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of donald trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us we need to come together united against a broken washington make donald trump a one term president and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves,4
Senator Bennet, we have to do it for them please join me at michaelbennetcom thanks for being here tonight,4
Speaker 1, governor inslee,4
Jay Inslee, for decades we have kicked the can down the road on climate change and now under donald trump we faced a looming catastrophe but it is not too late we have one last chance and when you have one chance in life you take it think about this literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president and we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us,4
Jay Inslee, and that includes making this the top priority of the next presidency and i alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration not the first day but every day and if you share my view of the urgency of this matter i hope youll join me because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests and it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuels special interests because that is our salvation what it depends upon,4
Jay Inslee, so i hope you will consider going to jayinsleecom and joining this effort and i will close with this i am confident and optimistic tonight even in the face of this difficulty because i know we can build a clean energy economy i know we can save our children and our grandchildren i know that we can defeat climate change and we will defeat donald trump this is our moral responsibility and we will fulfill it thank you very much,4
Speaker 1, senator gillibrand,4
Gillibrand, donald trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country dividing us on every racial line every religious line every socioeconomic line he can find im running for president because i want to help people and i actually have the experience and the ability to do that ive brought congress together and actually made a difference in peoples lives i also know how to beat donald trump he has broken his promises to the american people,4
Gillibrand, ive taken this fight directly to his backyard in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania and ill go to all the places in this country i will fight for your family doesnt matter who you are it doesnt matter where you live it doesnt matter who you love because thats my responsibility and ive done this before i started out in a two to one republican district i won it twice ive never lost an election since,4
Gillibrand, and i not only bring people together electorally but also legislatively i get things done so we need a president who is not afraid of the big challenges of the big fights there is no false choice we dont need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we dont need a moderate who can win back trumpobama voters you need someone who can do both and thats who i am please go to kirstengillibrandcom so i can make the next debate stage,4
Speaker 1, congresswoman gabbard,4
Tulsi Gabbard, thank you donald trump and warmongering politicians in washington have failed us they continue to escalate tensions with other nucleararmed countries like russia and china and north korea starting a new cold war pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe now as we stand here tonight there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us and if we were to get an attack right here tonight you would have 30 minutes 30 minutes before we were hit,4
Tulsi Gabbard, and you would receive an alert like the one we received in hawaii last year that would say incoming missile seek immediate shelter this is not a drill seek immediate shelter this is not a drill and you would see as we did as my loved ones in hawaii did there is no shelter this is the warmongers hoax there is no shelter its all a lie as president i will end this insanity because it doesnt have to be this way,4
Tulsi Gabbard, i will end these wasteful regime change wars work to end this new cold war through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that weve been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home things like healthcare for all making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe investing in education investing in our infrastructure the needs are great as your president i will put your interests above all else,4
Speaker 1, secretary castro,4
Julian Castro, well first of all let me say thank you to you jake dana and to don and to everybody here and to those watching this election is all about what kind of nation were going to become you and i we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices people that fought in wars and fought discrimination folks that pick crops and stood in picket lines and they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today,4
Julian Castro, donald trump has not been bashful in his cruelty and im not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion i believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation with one destiny and our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest the healthiest the fairest and the most prosperous nation on earth if you want to help me build that america for the future i hope youll go to juliancastrocom and on january 20th 2021 well say together adios to donald trump,4
Speaker 1, mr yang,4
Andrew Yang, you know what the talking heads couldnt stop talking about after the last debate its not the fact that im somehow number four on this stage in national polling it was the fact that i wasnt wearing a tie instead of talking about automation and our future including the fact that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs hundreds of thousands right here in michigan were up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality tv show its one reason why we elected a reality tv star as our president,4
Andrew Yang, we need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today like the fact that the most common job jobs in america may not exist in a decade or that most americans cannot pay their bills my flagship proposal the freedom dividend would put 1000 a month into the hands of every american adult be a game changer for millions of american families if you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear enter your zip code at yang2020com and see what 1000 a month would mean to your community i have done the math its not left its not right its forward and that is how were going to beat donald trump in 2020,4
Speaker 1, senator booker,4
Cory Booker, thank you first i just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of detroit theyre hosting us today and one of the reasons i respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that i find in many american cities including the city of newark and detroit is turning around and newark is turning around because we let no one divide us no one demean or degrade us or underestimate our worth we pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause,4
Cory Booker, thats the history of this city my mom is sitting there who was born in the city of detroit born to a guy that was a uaw worker my grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the depression my grandmother joined him she was really entrepreneurial opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city that is the american dream and so many of us have stories like that but the dream of this country is under threat right now,4
Cory Booker, well my moms generation 80 95 of baby boomers did better than their parents its now just a coin toss for millennials we have a real crises in our country and the crises is donald trump but not only donald trump i have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat donald trump well that is the floor and not the ceiling,4
Cory Booker, the way we beat donald trump is not just focusing on him he wants to take all the oxygen out of the room its when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before its whats gonna save us now that is the kind of leader that i am going to be as president of the united states not just uniting the democratic party but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under god and if you believe like i do please go to corybookercom and join the mission,4
Speaker 1, senator harris,4
Kamala Harris, so in my background as attorney general of california i took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another ive taken on the for profit colleges who preyed on students put them out of business ive preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children and i will tell you we have a predator living in the white house,4
Kamala Harris, and im going to tell you something donald trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts and the thing about predators is this by their very nature they prey on people they perceive to be weak they prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable they prey on people who are in need of help often desperate for help and predators are cowards what we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with donald trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years,4
Kamala Harris, and let me tell you weve got a long rap sheet were looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families weve got a person who was put babies in cages and separated children from their parents we have someone who passed his socalled trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on american families,4
Kamala Harris, so we must defeat him and then in turning the page write the next chapter for our country and that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at three oclock in the morning and that is my agenda the 300 am agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need getting their children the education they need making sure they have the healthcare they need and the future they deserve so please join me at kamalaharrisorg and i thank you for your time,4

Julian Castro, first we have to win and that means exciting a young diverse coalition of americans who are ready for a bold future thats what kennedy did its what carter did its what clinton did its what barack obama did and its what i can do in this race get back michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania florida georgia and arizona and finally turn texas blue and say goodbye to donald trump,5
George S., senator klobuchar,5
Amy Klobuchar, good evening texas southern i believe that what unites us up here the ten of us is much stronger than what divides us and i think thats true of our country too now i may not be the loudest person up here but i think weve already got that in the white house houston we have a problem we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show he would rather lie than lead i think we need something different i am someone that tells the truth i dont make promises that i cant keep i have peoples back and i believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern as well youre going to hear a lot of ideas up here some will be great but if you see that some of them seem a little off track ive got a better way if you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense youve got a home with me because i dont want to be the president for half of america i want to be the president for all of america,5
George S., congressman beto orourke,5
Beto O’Rourke, its an honor to be on this debate stage it is wonderful to be back in texas in houston back here at tsu on august 3rd in el paso texas two things became crystal clear for me and i think produced a turning point for this country the first is just how dangerous donald trump is the cost and the consequence of his presidency racism and violence that had long had been a part of america was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of el paso texas where 22 people were killed dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place inspired to kill by our president,5
Beto O’Rourke, the second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now the bitterness the pettiness the smallness of the moment the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions mountains out of molehills we have to be bigger we have to see clearly we have to speak honestly and we have to act decisively thats what i want to do for you as president of the united states thank you,5
George S., senator cory booker,5
Cory Booker, it was over twenty years ago that i was a law student and moved to inner city newark new jersey to serve as a tenants rights lawyer to try to address the challenges in my community i was sobered by them the gun violence the substandard housing but it was my greatest mentor a woman named ms virginia jones who challenged me she said boy if all you see in this neighborhood is problems thats all theres ever going to be but if youre stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people then we can make transformative change she was a church woman that said without vision the people will perish,5
Cory Booker, well thats exactly what we did we created extraordinary unity in our community and we did things that other people thought were impossible thats the story of america at our best we unify we find common cause and common purpose the differences amongst us democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party not just to beat donald trump but to unite america in common cause and common purpose thats why im running for president and thats how i will lead this nation,5
George S., entrepreneur andrew yang,5
Andrew Yang, in america today everything revolves around the almighty dollar our schools our hospitals our media even our government its why we dont trust our institutions anymore we have to get our country working for us again instead of the other way around we have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine,5
Andrew Yang, when you donate money to a presidential campaign what happens the politician spends the money on tv ads and consultants and you hope it works out its time to trust ourselves more than our politicians thats why im going to do something unprecedented tonight my campaign will now give a freedom dividend of 1000 a month for an entire year to 10 american families someone watching this at home right now if you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician go to yang2020com and tell us how 1000 a month will help you do just that this is how we will get our country working for us again the american people,5
George S., mayor pete buttigieg,5
Voiceover, thats good,5
Pete Buttigieg, its original ill give you that the american people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges weve ever seen as a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink as a veteran of the war in afghanistan i know whats at stake in our national leadership we keep sending politicians to washington asking them to fight for us but then when they get there they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us good politics is supposed to be not about the day to day fights of the politicians but about the day to day lives of americans,5
Pete Buttigieg, we just marked the anniversary of 911 all day today ive been thinking about september 12th the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time but big enough as well that they could unify the american people thats what presidential leadership can do thats what the presidency is for and that is why im asking for your vote,5
George S., senator kamala harris,5
Kamala Harris, thank you its great to be back at tsu i plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night first i have a few words for donald trump who we all know is watching president trump you spent the last two and a half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us and that is why weve gotten nothing done you have used hate intimidation fear and over 12000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises the only reason youve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the department of justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime heres what you dont get what you dont get is that the american people are so much better than this we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us regardless of our race where we live or the party with which were registered to vote i plan on focusing on our common issues our common hopes and desires and in that way unifying our country winning this election and turning the page for america now president trump you can go back to watching fox news,5
George S., senator bernie sanders senator sanders,5
Bernie Sanders, let me be blunt and tell you what you dont hear much about in congress or in the media and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat trump the most dangerous president in the history of this country we must do more we must do more we have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country as president i am prepared to take them on yes we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage yes we will finally make sure that every american has healthcare as a human right not a privilege yes we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,5
George S., senator elizabeth warren,5
E. Warren, i was born and raised in oklahoma but im sure glad to be in texas tonight all three of my brothers served in military bases here in texas that was their ticket to the middle class me i got my big opportunity about a half a mile down the road from here at the university of houston back when it cost  50 a semester for a price that i could pay for on a part time waitressing job i got to finish my four year degree and i became a special needs teacher after law school my first big job was back here in houston by then i had two little kids and when childcare nearly brought me down my aunt  moved in and saved us all the paths to americas middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower today service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare i know whats broken i know how to fix it and im going to lead the fight to get it done,5
George S., vice president joe biden,5
Joe Biden, you know when president kennedy announced the moon shot he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life he said were doing it because we refused to postpone well i refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer alzheimers and other diseases which if we invest in them we can find cures i refuse to postpone giving every single child in america no matter their zip code prek all the way through high school and beyond i refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change look this is the united states of america there has never been a single solitary time when weve set our mind to something that weve not been able to do it were walking around with our heads down like woe is me were the best equipped nation in the world to take this on its no longer time to postpone we should get moving theres enormous enormous opportunities once we get rid of donald trump,5
George S., candidates thank you several of you said you are more united than divided and that is certainly true all of you agree on one big thing the goal of defeating president trump driving the country in a new direction out on the campaign trail you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go vice president biden the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate both senators warren and sanders want to replace obamacare with medicare for all you want to build on obamacare and not scrap it they proposed spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt and they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs are senators warren and sanders pushing too far beyond where democrats want to go and where the country needs to go,5
Joe Biden, thatll be for the voters to decide that question let me tell you what i think i think we should have a debate on health care i know that the senator says shes for bernie well im for barack i think the obamacare worked i think the way in which we add to it replace everything thats been cut add a public option guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance number one,5
Joe Biden, number two i think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are my plan for health care costs a lot of money it costs 740 billion it doesnt cost 30 trillion 34 trillion a year it turns out is twice what the entire federal budget is thats before it exists now without interest on the debt how are we going to pay for it i want to hear tonight how thats happened,5
Joe Biden, as far as my distinguished friend the senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it the senator has in fact come forward and said how hes going to pay for it but it gets him about halfway there theres a lot of other things that need to be done i have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools that are title one schools from 15 to 45 billion a year i go down the line and each of the things were talking about i lay out how i can pay for it how i can get it done and why its better,5
George S., senator warren let me take that to you particularly on what senator biden was saying there about healthcare hes actually praised bernie sanders for being candid about his healthcare plan says that senator sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated will you make that same admission,5
E. Warren, lets be clear about healthcare and lets actually start where vice president did we all owe a huge debt to president obama who fundamentally transformed healthcare in america and committed this country to healthcare for every human being now the question is how best can we improve on it i believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost how do we pay for it we pay for it those at the very top the richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more and middle class families are going to pay less thats how this is going to work,5
George S., direct question you said middle class families are going to pay less but will middle class taxes go up to pay for the program i know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down will middle class taxes go up will private insurance be eliminated,5
E. Warren, look what families have to deal with is cost total cost thats what they have to deal with understand families are paying for their health care today families pay every time an insurance company says sorry you cant see that specialist every time an insurance company says sorry that doctor is out of network sorry we are not covering that prescription families are paying every time they dont get a prescription filled because they cant pay for it they dont have a lump checked out because they cant afford the copay what were talking about here is whats going to happen in families pockets whats going to happen in their budgets the answer is on medicare for all costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations but for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down thats how it should work under medicare for all in our health care,5
George S., senator sanders you were invoked by the vice president also take on that question about taxes,5
Bernie Sanders, joe said that medicare for all would cost over 30 trillion thats right joe status quo over 10 years will be 50 trillion every study done shows that medicare for all is the most cost effective approach to providing healthcare to every man woman and child in this country i who wrote the damn bill if i may say so intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses all deductibles all copayments nobody in america will pay more than 200 a year for prescription drugs because were going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price fixing of the pharmaceutical industry we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does not a system which provides 100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies to tell you how absurd the system is tonight on abc the healthcare industry will be advertising telling you how bad medicare for all is because they want to protect their profits that is absurd,5
George S., vice president biden you were invoked,5
Amy Klobuchar, if i could respond george,5
George S., you get a response then were going to broaden out the discussion,5
Joe Biden, okay number one my healthcare plan does significantly cut the cost the largest out of pocket payment youll pay is 1000 youll be able to get into a anyone who cant afford it gets automatically enrolled in the medicare type option we have et cetera but guess what of the 160 million people who liked their health care now they can keep it if they dont like it they can leave number one,5
Joe Biden, number two the fact of the matter is were in a situation where if you noticed he hadnt answered the question this is about candor honesty big ideas lets have a big idea the tax of 2 the senators talking about that raises about 3 billion guess what that leaves you about 28 billion short the senator said before its going to cost you in your pay there will be a deductible in your paycheck the middle class person someone making 60 grand for three kids theyre going to end up paying 5000 more theyre going to end up paying 4 more on their income tax thats a reality now its not a bad idea if you like it i dont like it,5
George S., okay now i want everybody to keep to the time but you did invoke both senators i have to get responses from them then we will broaden out senator warren you go first,5
E. Warren, lets be clear ive actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company ive met people who like their doctors ive met people who like their nurses ive met people who like their pharmacists i met people who like their physical therapists what they want is access to health care and we just need to be clear about what medicare for all is all about instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage were going to do this by saying everyone is covered by medicare for all every healthcare provider is covered the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill,5
George S., senator sanders,5
Bernie Sanders, let us be clear joe in the united states of america we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the canadians or any other major country on earth,5
Joe Biden, this is america,5
Bernie Sanders, yeah but americans dont want to pay twice as much as other countries and they guarantee health care to all people under my medicare for all proposal when you dont pay out of pocket and you dont pay premiums maybe you have run into people who love their premiums i havent what people want is cost effective health care medicare for all will save the average american substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill,5
George S., senator klobuchar you said in your opening statement you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes who represents the extreme on this stage,5
Amy Klobuchar, i think you know that i dont agree with some of these proposals up here george im talking about,5
George S., which ones,5
Amy Klobuchar, if i could respond to some of the proposals but from my friends first of all senator sanders and i have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals that was a klobuchar sanders amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like canada we have worked to bring down the costs by fighting to allow 43 million seniors thats a bill i lead to negotiate for better prices under medicare i figure thats a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price,5
Amy Klobuchar, when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums i go with the doctors creed which is do no harm while bernie wrote the bill i read the bill on page eight on page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it that means that 149 million americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance thats in four years i dont think thats a bold idea i think its a bad idea what i favor is something that what barack obama wanted to do from the very beginning and that is a public option a nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance cover 12 million more people and bring down the prices for 13 million more people that is a bold idea,5
George S., senator warren page eight of the bill she says 149 people will lose their health insurance,5
E. Warren, im sorry,5
George S., she said page eight of the bill 149 people will lose their health insurance,5
Amy Klobuchar, current health insurance,5
Joe Biden, 149 million,5
George S., million excuse me,5
E. Warren, lets be clear about this people will have access to all of their doctors all of their nurses their community hospitals their rural hospitals doctors wont have to hire people to fill out crazy forms they wont have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies people who have sick family members wont have to get into these battles what this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country insurance companies last year sucked 23 billion in profits out of the system how did they make that money every one of those 23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare company,5
George S., mayor buttigieg,5
Pete Buttigieg, the problem senator sanders with that damn bill that you wrote and that senator warren backed,5
Pete Buttigieg,  with that damn bill that you wrote and that senator warren backs is that it doesnt trust the american people i trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you not my way or the highway now look i think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the aca i propose medicare for all who want it we take a version of medicare we make it available for the american people and if were right as progressives that that public alternative is better then the american people will figure that out for themselves i trust the american people to make the right choice for them whey dont you,5
George S., senator sanders 45 seconds,5
Bernie Sanders, george you talked about was it 150 million people on private insurance 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy medicare for all is comprehensive healthcare covers all basic needs including home healthcare it allows you to go to any doctor you want which many private insurance company programs do not so if you want comprehensive healthcare freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital no more than 200 dollars a year for prescription drugs taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies moving to medicare for all is a way to go,5
George S., senator harris you started out cosponsoring senator sanders bill you now say youre uncomfortable with it why,5
Kamala Harris, i want to give credit first to barrack obama for really bringing us this far we would not be here if he hadnt the courage the talent or the will to see us this far i want to give credit to bernie take credit bernie you brought us this far in medicare for all i support medicare for all i always have but i wanted to make the plan better which i did which is about offering people choice not taking that from them so under my medicare for all plan people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan because thats what people want and i agree we shouldnt take choice from people but heres the thing everybody on this stage i do believe is wellintentioned and wants that all americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million americans dont have coverage but at least five people have talked some repeatedly on this subject and not once have we talked about donald trump,5
Kamala Harris, so lets talk about the fact that donald trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the affordable care act we all fought against it and then the late great john mccain at that moment at about 200 in the morning killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country fastforward to today and what is happening donald trumps department of justice is trying to get rid of the affordable care act donald trumps administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage donald trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans and frankly i think this discussion have given the american public a headache what they want to know is that theyre going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it but lets focus on the end goal if we dont get donald trump out of office hes going to get rid of all of it,5
Joe Biden, 15 seconds,5
George S., let me get to congressman orourke and then  go ahead mr vice president,5
Joe Biden, 15 seconds look everybody says we want an option the option im proposing is a medicare for all in a medicare for choice if you want medicare if you lose the job from your employer you automatically can buy into this you dont have no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in you get covered period and if you notice nobodys yet said how much its going to cost the taxpayer i hear this large savings my friend from vermont thinks that employers going to give you back if negotiate his union all these years got to cut wages because youve got insurance theyre going to give back that money to the employee,5
Bernie Sanders, as a matter of fact they will with our bill,5
Joe Biden, well let me tell you something for a socialist you got a lot more confidence in corporate america than i do,5
Bernie Sanders, one minute george,5
George S., go ahead,5
Bernie Sanders, all right two points you got to defend the fact that today not only do we 87 million people uninsured and underinsured you got to defend the fact that 500000 americans are going bankrupt you know why theyre going bankrupt because they suffered a terrible disease cancer or heart disease under my legislation people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer and our program is the only one that does that,5
Joe Biden, i know a lot about cancer let me tell you something its personal to me let me tell you something every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan they will not go bankrupt because of that they will not go bankrupt because of that they can join immediately and were talking four six eight 10 years depending on you talk about before we get to medicare for all come on ive been there youve been there you know what its like people need help now hope now and do something now,5
George S., congressman orourke,5
Beto O’Rourke, yeah thank you listen im grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that donald trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now but i also think were being offered a false choice between those who propose an allornothing gambit forcing 10s of millions off of insurance that they like that works for them to force them onto medicare and others who want to as the vice president does incrementally improve what we have which will still leave many maybe millions uninsured and uncared for in a state like texas where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is the county jail system weve got to do better in my proposal medicare for america say everyone whos uninsured will be enrolled in medicare everyone whos insufficiently insured cannot afford it can move over to medicare and those like members of unions who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families are able to keep them that is the best possible path forward,5
Joe Biden, this is the  plan,5
George S., healthcare is the top issue for everyone in the country i want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond so senator secretary castro andrew yang and then senator booker you will get a minute,5
Julian Castro, thank you i also want to recognize the work that bernie has done on this and of course we owe a debt of gratitude to president barrack obama of course i also worked for president obama vice president biden and i know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered now on the last debate stage in detroit you said that wasnt true when senator harris brought that up there was a fact check of that and they said that was true i grew up with a grandmother who had type two diabetes and i watched her condition get worse and worse but that whole time she had medicare i want every single american family to have a strong medicare plan available,5
Julian Castro, if they choose to hold onto strong solid private health insurance i believe they should be able to do that but the difference between what i support and what you support vice president biden is that you require them to opt in and i would not require them to opt in they would automatically be enrolled they wouldnt have to buy in thats a big difference because barrack obamas vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered he wanted every single person in this country covered my plan would do that your plan would not,5
Joe Biden, they do not have to buy in they do not have to buy in,5
Julian Castro, you just said that you just said that two minutes ago you just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in,5
Joe Biden, they do not have to buy in if they cant afford it,5
Julian Castro, you said they would have to buy in,5
Joe Biden, your grandmother would not have to buy in if she qualified for medicaid shed automatically be in for it,5
Julian Castro, are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago i cant believe that you said two minute ago that they had to buy in and now youre saying they dont have to buy in youre forgetting that,5
Joe Biden, i said anyone like your grandmother who has no money youre automatically enrolled,5
Julian Castro, we need a healthcare system that automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not if you lose your job for instance his healthcare plan would not automatically enroll you you would have to opt in my healthcare plan would thats a big difference im fulfilling the legacy of barack obama and youre not,5
Joe Biden, thatll be a surprise to him,5
George S., andrew yang,5
Andrew Yang, come on guys come on,5
Pete Buttigieg, this is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable because this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about washington scoring points against each other poking at each other and telling each other that your plan my plan look we all,5
Julian Castro, yeah thats called the democratic primary election thats called an election thats an election this is what were here for its an election,5
Amy Klobuchar, yeah but a house divided cannot stand and that is not how were going to win this election,5
George S., andrew yang,5
Andrew Yang, look everyone we know were on the same team here we know were on the same team we all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president and i believe were talking about this the wrong way as someone who has a business i know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people it makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as fulltime employees you instead pretend theyre contractors its harder to change jobs its certainly harder to start a business the pitch we have to make to the american people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the american people,5
Andrew Yang, now i am asian so i know a lot of doctors and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork avoiding being sued and navigating the insurance bureaucracy we have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity people are focused on our health in the healthcare system and the cleveland clinic where theyre paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe shocker they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves that is the pitch to the american people,5
George S., senator booker close out this discussion,5
Cory Booker, thank you very much look there are a lot of people watching at home right now listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis they dont have health insurance or health insurance doesnt go far enough they cant afford their prescription drugs look im clear on what i believe i believe in medicare for all i believe its the best way to rationalize the system but dear god i know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions ill tell you there is an urgency right now in this nation everybody feels it as a person who has an ideal i know we cannot sacrifice progress on the alter of purity because people in my community they need help right now,5
Cory Booker, they have high blood pressure right now they have unaffordable insulin right now and this must be a moment where we as democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground but find common ground because weve got one shot to make donald trump a one term president and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other we can walk and chew gum at the same time if i am the leader i will work towards the ideal of health insurance health coverage being a right for all americans but every single day ill join with other democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today,5
George S., candidates thank you lindsey davis,5
Voiceover, thanks george since were here at an hbcu id like to start with young black voters several recent polls indicate their number one concern is racism this campus this state and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on latinos in el paso now we know that the racial divide started long before president trump and president obama but each of you on this stage has said that president trump has made that divide worse congressman orourke coming to you first why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide,5
Beto O’Rourke, i called this out in no uncertain terms on august 3rd and every day since then and i was talking about it long before then as well racism in america is endemic it is foundational we can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of july 1776 but august 20th 1619 when the first kidnapped african was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave build the greatness the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy we have to be able to answer this challenge and it is found in our education system where in texas a five year old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin,5
Beto O’Rourke, in our healthcare system where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color or the fact that theres 10 times the wealth in white america than there is in black america im going to follow sheila jackson lees lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundations but we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the white house and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country,5
Voiceover, secretary castro 45 seconds to explain,5
Julian Castro, i want to commend beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of el paso hes done a great job with that look a few weeks ago a shooter drove 10 hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family white supremacy is a growing threat to this country and we have to root it out im proud that i put forward a plan to disarm hate im also proud that i was the first to put forward a police reform plan because were not going have anymore laquan mcdonalds or eric garners or michael browns or pamela turners or walter scotts or sandra bland here from the houston area we need to root out racism and i believe that we can do that because that doesnt represent the vast majority of americans who do have a good heart they also need a leader to match that and i will be a president that matches that,5
Voiceover, senator booker you have said quote the real question isnt who is or isnt a racist its whos going to do something about it senator what do you plan to do about it,5
Cory Booker, well first and foremost i want to hit that point because we know donald trumps a racist but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that racism exists the question isnt who isnt a racist its who is and isnt doing something about racism and this is not just an issue that started yesterday its not just an issue that we hear a president that cant condemn white supremacy we have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from healthcare to the criminal justice system and its nice to go all the way back to slavey but dear god we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more africanamericans under criminal supervision today that all the slaves in 1850,5
Cory Booker, we have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it if i am president of the united states we will create an office in the white house to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare to even one that we dont talk about enough which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country,5
Voiceover, mayor buttigieg youve been struggling with issues around race in your own community youve also said that anyone who votes to reelect president trump is at best looking the other way on racism does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country,5
Pete Buttigieg, i believe whats deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president and we have a change all of that look systemic racism preceded this president and even when we defeat him it will be with us thats why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it its not enough to just take a racist policy replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own harms compound in the same way that a dollar saved compound so does a dollar stolen and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts in two different countries i have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas,5
Pete Buttigieg, marshaling as many resources as went into the marshal plan that rebuilt europe but this time a douglas plan that we invest right here at home to make sure that were not only dealing with things like the overincarceration of black americans but also black solutions entrepreneurship raising to 25 the target for the federal government to do business with minorityowned businesses investing in hpcus that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs we can and must do that but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced autoworker because where i come from a lot of times that displaced autoworker is a single black mother of three weve got to say that and bring people together,5
Voiceover, also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform senator harris you released your plan for that just this week and it does contradict some of your prior positions among them you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana now you dont you used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings now you dont youve said that youve changed on these and other things because you were quote swimming against the current and thankfully the currents have changed but when you had the power why didnt you try to affect change then,5
Kamala Harris, im glad you asked me this question and there have been many distortions of my record let me be very clear i made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons one ive always wanted to protect people and keep them safe and second i was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in america has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias and i could tell you extensively about the experiences i and my family members have personally had but i made a decision that if i was going to have the ability to reform the system i would try to do it from the inside so i took on the position that allowed me without asking permission to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs i created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on fulltime,5
Kamala Harris, i created one of the first in the nation training for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system was i able to get enough done absolutely not but my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system i plan on shutting down forprofit prisons on day one it will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement including prosecutors accountable and finally my plan is about making sure that in americas criminal justice system we deincarcerate woman and children that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact and as president of the united states knowing the system from the inside i will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,5
Voiceover, thank you senator harris senator klobuchar during your eight years as a prosecutor in minnesota there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases the aclus legal director in minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice do you wish now that you had done more,5
Amy Klobuchar, thats not my record we are here at a historically black college and i think of an alum of that college barbara jordan and something she once said she said what the people want is simple they want a country as good as its promise and that same can be said of the criminal justice system so when i was there the way we handled these police shootings i actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them i took on our major police chief in minneapolis but in the prosecutors office they were handled with a grand jury thats how they were all handled across our state i now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself that aside i am proud of the work our staff did 400 people in our office the cases that came to us the africanamerican community that came to us they said there was no justice for their little kids there was a kid named byron philips that was shot on his front porch no one had bothered to figure out who did it,5
Amy Klobuchar, when i came into that office we worked with the community groups we put up billboards we found the shooter and we put him in jail we did the same for the killer of a little girl named taisha edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window what changes did we make go after white collar crimes in a big way diversify the office in a big way work with the innocence project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness id and as a senator and as your president i will make sure that we dont just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing that we move to the second step act which means the 90 of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails lets reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and lets get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison,5
Voiceover, thank you senator klobuchar you all believe that the war on drugs has put too many americans behind bars vice president biden you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison senator booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough your response,5
Joe Biden, well first of all let me say that when i came back from law school i had a job with a big time law firm i left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when dr king was assassinated we were occupied by the national guard for 10 months ive been involved from the beginning as a young councilman i introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood i made sure that we dealt with redlining banks should have to lend where they operate etc the fact of the matter is that whats happened is that were in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldnt be in jail the whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change we should be talking about rehabilitation nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime when we were in the white house we released 36000 people from the federal prison system nobody should be in jail for a drug problem,5
Joe Biden, they should be going directly to a rehabilitation we build more rehabilitation centers not prisons im the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system so we have to change the whole way we look at this and we put people in prison we have to equip them when they get out nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldnt be in there for a misdemeanor that should be a misdemeanor they should be out and their record should be expunged every single right should be returned when you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote but have access to pell grants have access to be able to get housing have access to be able to move along the way ive laid out a detailed plan along those lines and the fact is weve learned so much more about,5
Voiceover, thank you mr vice president,5
Joe Biden, thank you,5
Voiceover, senator booker 45 seconds to respond,5
Cory Booker, our criminal justice system is so savagely broken theres no difference in american between blacks whites and latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs but if youre africanamerican youre almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated destroying your lives and so much of this comes down to privilege we have a criminal justice system that bryan stevenson says treats you better if youre rich and guilty than if youre poor and innocent so i have challenged this whole field we can specifically and demonstratively now show that there are 17000 people unjustly incarcerated in america and all of us should come forward and say when i am president of the united states we will release them and let me be specific i joined together and led in the united states senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass onto this president for criminal justice reform that has already led to 1000s of people coming out of jail,5
Cory Booker, if 87 members of the united states senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it but we didnt make it retractive we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17000 people and i challenge you dont just say big statements back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation which is liberty and freedom we need to reform this system and we must do it now every day we wait is too long,5
Voiceover, thank you senator booker david,5
David Muir, thank you lindsey i want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country and of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand we are here in texas tonight where 29 people have lost their lives in just the last month along el paso which weve discussed and odessa and i know there are survivors from el paso right here in the hall tonight vice president biden i do want to direct this to you because we all remember sandy hook 26 people died in that school 20 of them children those first graders would be in eighth grade today at the time there was a groundswell in this country to get something done president obama asked you to lead the push for gun control you have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done but four months after sandy hook a measure to require expanded background checks died on the senate floor if you couldnt get it done after sandy hook why should voters give you another chance,5
Joe Biden, because ive got it done before im the only one up here whos ever beat the nra only one to ever beat the nra nationally im the guy that brought the brady bill into focus and became law so thats number one number two after sandy hook a number of things happened its went from a cause to a movement look whats happened now mothers the organization mothers against gun violence weve seen whats happened again now we have all these young people marching on washington making sure that things are going to change there has been a sea change those proposals i put forward for the president had over 50 of members of the nra supporting them and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them now the numbers are much higher because they realize what ive been saying and weve all been saying is correct over 90 of the american people think we have to get assault weapons ,5
Joe Biden, correct over 90 of the american people think we have to get assault weapons off the street period and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements so the point is things have changed and things have changed a lot and now whats happening is and by the way the way beto handled excuse me for saying beto congressman,5
Beto O’Rourke, thats all right that sounds good,5
Joe Biden, the way he handled what happened in his home town is meaningful the look in the eyes of those people to see those kids to understand those parents to understand the heartache we are ready to do this,5
David Muir, mr vice president thank you you did bring up assault weapons here and many of you on this stage have talked about executive orders senator harris you have said that you would take executive action on guns within your first 100 days including banning imports of ar15 assault weapons,5
Kamala Harris, thats right,5
David Muir, president obama after sandy hook more than 23 executive actions and yet here we are today in recent days former vice president biden has said about executive orders some really talented people are seeking the nomination they said im going to issue an executive order biden saying theres no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say im going to eliminate assault weapons saying you cant do it by executive order any more than trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order does the vice president have a point there,5
Joe Biden, some things you can many things you cant,5
David Muir, lets let the senator answer,5
Kamala Harris, i mean i would just say hey joe instead of saying that we cant let say yes we can,5
Joe Biden, thats not constitutional we got a constitution,5
Kamala Harris, yes we can because ill tell you something the way that i think about this is ive seen more autopsy photographs than i care to tell you i have attended more police officer funerals than i care to tell you i have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than i care to tell you and the idea that we would wait for this congress which has just done nothing to act is just it is overlooking the fact that every day in america our babies are going to school to have drills elementary middle and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school,5
Kamala Harris, i was talking about this at one of my town halls and this child was eight years old probably came up to me it was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said i had to have one of those drills it is traumatizing our children el paso and beto god love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy people asked me in el paso they said because i have a long standing record on this issue they said well do you think trump is responsible for what happened and i said well look i mean obviously he didnt pull the trigger but hes certainly been tweeting out the ammunition,5
David Muir, senator harris thank you vice president biden do you still stand by what you said on executive order,5
Joe Biden, what i said was speak to constitutional scholars if in fact we could say by the way you cant own the following weapons period it cannot be sold anymore check with constitutional scholars,5
David Muir, mr vice president thank you congressman orourke,5
Kamala Harris, could i tell you what you could do to respond today,5
David Muir, im going to work down the row here but i do want to come to congressman orourke because i know this is personal to you el paso is your hometown some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buyback for guns in this country youve gone further you said americans who owned ar15s and ak47 will have to sell them to the government all of them you know the critics call this confiscation are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work,5
Beto O’Rourke, i am if its a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield if the high impact high velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers when we see that being used against children and in odessa i met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an ar15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that ar15 in odessa and midland there werent enough ambulances to get to them in time yes were going to take your ar15 your ak47 were not going to allow it to be used against our fellow americans anymore,5
David Muir, thank you congressman,5
Beto O’Rourke, and i want to say this im listening to the people of this country the day after i proposed doing that i went to a gun show in conway arkansas to meet with those who are selling ar15s and ak47s and those who are buying those weapons and you might be surprised there was some common ground there folks who said i would willingly give that up cut it to pieces i dont need this weapon to hunt to defend myself it is a weapon of war so lets do the right thing but lets bring everyone in america into the conversation republicans democrats gun owners and non gun owners alike,5
David Muir, congressman thank you i want to bring in senator klobuchar on this because youve often talked about your uncle and the proud hunters back home in minnesota so i wanted to get your response to congressman orourke tonight where do you stand on mandatory gun buybacks,5
Amy Klobuchar, i so appreciate what the congressmans been doing and i want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us everyone up here favors an assault weapon pan everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place in el paso in that store where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in dayton ohio where in 30 seconds one man guns down innocent people the cops got there in one minute and it still wasnt enough to save those people thats what unites us,5
Amy Klobuchar, you know what else unites us and ill tell you this what unites us is that right now on mitch mcconnells desk are three bills universal background checks closing the charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers dont get ak47,5
David Muir, senator klobuchar,5
Amy Klobuchar, its time to get something done and i personally think we should start with the voluntary buyback program thats what i think david but i want to finish this because if you want action now we got to send a message to mitch mcconnell we cant wait until one of us gets in the white house we have to pass those bills right now to get this done,5
David Muir, senator klobuchar,5
Amy Klobuchar, because we cannot spare another innocent life,5
David Muir, thank you i want to turn to senator booker because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage that the differences do matter those were your words you have argued if you need a license to drive a car in this country you should have a license to buy a gun gun owners would not only have to pass a background check they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun this would require as you know congress to pass legislation if democrats cant get universal background checks how would you get this done and can you name one republican colleague of yours in the senate right now who would be on board with this idea,5
Cory Booker, so background checks and gun licensing these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of americans 83 of americans agree with licensing this is the issue look i grew up in the suburbs it was about 20 years ago that i came out of my home when i moved to inner city new jersey and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting its one of the reasons why shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades this has been a crisis for me its why i was the first person to come out for gun licensing and im happy that people like beto orourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing but this is what im sorry about im sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting beto to suddenly make us demand change this is a crisis of empathy in our nation,5
Cory Booker, we are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood our community before we demand action you want to know how we get this done we get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people dont wait for this hell to visit upon their communities they stand up and understand the truth of what king said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere i will lead change on this issue because i have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine because we forget national shootings these mass shootings or tragedies but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine nobody has ascended to the white house that will bring more personal passion on this issue i will fight this and bring a fight to the nra and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before,5
David Muir, senator booker thank you a quick follow up though because americans watching tonight know the reality of congress in washington i asked you how the republican colleague in the senate who would be on board with this idea to get this done,5
Cory Booker, if that was the attitude when strom thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights if it was this idea that we cant get it done because of the situation in the senate im looking to lead a movement the number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry think about this we have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the revolutionary war till now this is not a side issue to me it is a central issue to me that is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine,5
Cory Booker, we must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those republicans who are not even representing their constituency because the majority of americans the majority of gun owners agree with me not the corporate gun lobby it is time for a movement on this issue and i will lead it,5
David Muir, senator booker thank you senator warren i want to come to you next because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with republicans in the senate what can you get done on gun control,5
E. Warren, so lets start by framing the problem the right way we have a gun violence problem in this country the mass shootings are terrible but they get all the headlines children die every day on streets in neighborhoods on playgrounds people die from violence from suicide and domestic abuse we have a gun violence problem in this country and we agree on many steps we could take to fix it my view on this is its not going to be won and done on this were going to do it and were going to have to do it again and were going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly but heres the deal the question we need to ask is when weve got this much support across the country 90 of americans want to see us do,5
E. Warren, i like registration want to see us do background checks want to get assault weapons off the streets why doesnt it happen and the answer is corruption pure and simple we have a congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless were willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster were not going to get anything done on guns i was in the united states senate when 54 senators said lets do background checks lets get rid of assault weapons and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster until we attack the systemic problems we cant get done reform in this country weve got to go straight against the industry and weve got to change congress so it doesnt just work for the wealthy and well conducted so it works for the people,5
David Muir, senator warren thank you you bring up eliminating the filibuster which means you would need simply a simple majority in a republican senate to get something done i want to turn to senator sanders on this because youve said before of this if donald trump supports ending the filibuster which hes talked about himself you should be nervous would you support ending the filibuster,5
Bernie Sanders, no but what i would support absolutely is passing major legislation the gun legislation the people here are talking about medicare for all climate change legislation that saves the planet i will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen and you could do it in a variety of ways you could do that through budget reconciliation law you have a vice president who will in fact tell the senate what is appropriate and what is not what is an order and what is not,5
Bernie Sanders, but i want to get back to a point that elizabeth made and that in fact in terms of gun issues picking up on corey and beto and everybody else what we are looking at is a corrupt political system and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining whats happening in washington or in this case you got an nra which has intimidated the president of the united states and the republican leadership i am proud that year after year i had an f rating from the nra and as president i will not be intimidated by the nra,5
David Muir, senator sanders thank you,5
Kamala Harris, can i respond,5
Jorge Ramos, weve been hearing a lot about whats been happening here in texas only a few weeks ago the deadliest massacre of latinos in modern us history happening in the states in el paso so the if youre among latinos and you know this is very real so let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country immigration vice president biden as a presidential candidate in 2008 you supported the border wall saying unlike most democrats i voted for 700 miles of fence this is what you said then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people the most ever in us history did you do anything to prevent those deportations i mean youve been asked this question before and refused to answer so let me try once again are you prepared to say tonight that you and president obama made a mistake about deportations why should latinos trust you,5
Joe Biden, what latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous number one we didnt lock people up in cages we didnt separate families we didnt do all of those things number one number two this is the president who came along with the daca program no one had ever done that before the president sent legislation to desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the united states of america this is the president has done a great deal so im proud to have served with him what i would do as president is several more things because things have changed,5
Joe Biden, i would in fact make sure that we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum they deserve to be heard thats who we are were a nation that says if you want to flee and youre fleeing oppression you should come i would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum and by the way retrospectively you know the 25th anniversary of the violence against women act is up the republican congress has not reauthorized it lets put pressure on them to pass the violence against women act now,5
Jorge Ramos, you didnt answer the question no did you make a mistake with those deportations,5
Joe Biden, the president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,5
Jorge Ramos, how about you,5
Joe Biden, im the vice president of the united states,5
Jorge Ramos, secretary castro would you want to respond to biden and let me put this in context because your party controlled the white house and congress in 2009 and didnt pass immigration reform and just broke a promise made by president barack obama to latinos so why should voters trust democrats now i mean now it is even more difficult as you know because you need republican votes in the senate so are you willing for instance to give up daca or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 105 million undocumented immigrants,5
Julian Castro, jorge thank you very much for that question and you look i agree that barack obama was very different from donald trump donald trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants he built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants and thats very different for barack obama but my problem with vice president biden and corey pointed this out last time is every time something good about barack obama comes up he says i was there thats me too and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of he says well that was the president i mean he wants to take credit for obamas work but not have to answer to any questions,5
Jorge Ramos, vice president biden you have,5
Julian Castro, i dont get that,5
Jorge Ramos, you have 45 seconds,5
Julian Castro, let me just say,5
Joe Biden, thats not what i said thats not what i said,5
Julian Castro, i was the first candidate in early april to put forward an immigration plan you know why because im not afraid of donald trump on this issue im not going to back pedal im not going to pretend like i dont have my own vision for immigration so were not going to give up daca were not going to give up protections for anybody i believe that on january 20th 2021 were going to have a democratic president were going to throw out mitch mcconnell and john cornyn and have a democratic senate and a democratic house and were going to pass immigration reform within the first hundred days,5
Jorge Ramos, vice president 45 seconds,5
Joe Biden, i did not say dont stand i stand with barack obama all eight years good bad and indifferent thats where i stand i did not say i did not stand with him,5
Jorge Ramos, okay senator warren hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border and recently in mississippi we saw the largest immigration rate in a decade you want to replace ice the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants so how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrived legally but overstayed their visas and how would you stop hundreds of thousands of central americans who want to migrate to the us,5
E. Warren, well i start with a statement of principles and that is in this country immigration does not make us weaker immigration makes us stronger i want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers but also for their grandparents and for their cousins for people whos overstayed student visas and for people who came here to work in the fields i want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable down at the border weve got to rework this entirely a system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist a criminal and a 12 year old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values,5
Jorge Ramos, mr yang,5
E. Warren, i want to add one more part on this because i think we have to look at all the pieces why do we have a crisis at the border in no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in central america who are suffering we need to restore that help we need to help establish and reestablish the rule of law so that people dont feel like they have to flee for their lives we have a crisis that donald trump has created and hopes to profit from politically we have to have the courage to stand up and fight back,5
Jorge Ramos, mr yang it is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe antiimmigrant measures from putting kids in cages to limiting and asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence but it is also true that about 1 million immigrants enter the us legally every year so are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year and should there be a merit system as president trump wants,5
E. Warren, did you ask me,5
Jorge Ramos, mr yang,5
E. Warren, he said it okay sorry,5
Andrew Yang, my father grew up on a peanut farm in asia with no floor and now his son is running for president that is the immigration story that we have to be able to share it with the american people if you look at our history almost half of fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities we have to say to the american people immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism and i would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the obama biden administration,5
Andrew Yang, i think we have to compete for talent and i am the opposite of donald trump in many ways he says build a wall im going to say to immigrants come to america because if you come here your son or daughter can run for president the waters great and this is where you want to build a company build a family and build a life this country has been a magnet for human capital for generations if we lose that we lose something integral to our continued success and that is where i would lead as president,5
Jorge Ramos, pete eight out of 10 latinos in texas in another mass shooting targeting them this is according to a new television post president trump has called mexican immigrants rapists and killers tried to ban muslims from entering the country and separated children from their parents his supporters kept chanting build a wall and send her back do you think that people who support president trump and his immigration policies are racist,5
Pete Buttigieg, anyone who supports this is supporting racism  the only people though who actually buy into this presidents hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who dont know any we have an opportunity to build an american majority around immigration reform in my community a group of conservative republicans rallied around an individual a beloved local individual who was deported when he went in to ice to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him in some of the most conservative rural areas of iowa i have seen communities that embraced immigration grow and its why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural america includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city,5
Pete Buttigieg, the only reason that south bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration its one of the reasons we acted not waiting for washington to create city issued municipal ids so that people regardless of immigration status in our city had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification we have an opportunity to actually get something done,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you,5
Pete Buttigieg, but we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s we have to actually engage the american majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities but our values values of welcome values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws,5
Jorge Ramos, congress beto orourke  in an interview eight months ago you were asked what to do with a socalled overstay people who come with a visa and then stay and you said i dont know do you have an answer now,5
Beto O’Rourke, i do and if you read the rest of that article in the washington post i talked about harmonizing our entry exit system with mexico in the same way that we do with canada i think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstays but i think the larger question that were trying to get at is how do we rewrite this countrys immigration laws in our own image in the image of houston texas the most diverse city in the united states of america in the image of el paso texas one of the safest cities in the united states of america safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants safe because we are a city of immigrants ,5
Beto O’Rourke, i will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way never cage another child make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody but also face the fact that democrats and republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job that we have been part of deporting people hundreds of thousands just in the obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country breaking up their families democrats have to get off the back foot we have to lead on this issue because we know it is right legalize america begin with those more than 1 million dreamers make them us citizens right now in this their true home country and extend that to their parents their sisters and their brothers and ensure that we have a legal safe orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you george,5
George S., jorge thank you were going to take a quick break when we come back national security foreign policy the impact on american jobs and us troops,5
Speaker 1, texas southern university in houston the democratic debate,5
George S, welcome back we want to turn now to national security and the foreign policy issue that has such a direct impact here at home the us relationship with china trade and president trumps tariffs we received more than a hundred questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs and mr yang let me begin with you would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office and if so would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with china,5
Andrew Yang, i would not repeal the tariffs on day one but i would let the chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with china,5
Andrew Yang, a ceo friend of mine was in china recently and he said that he saw pirated us intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head and he said one how can my workers compete against that and two think about all the lost revenue to american companies so the imbalances are real but we have to let the chinese know that we recognize that president trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides so no to repealing the tariffs immediately but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of american companies and american producers,5
George S, mayor pete let me take that question to you because youve seen president trumps tweets he says whats going to happen here is the chinese are just going to wait him out so they can get a democrat who they can take advantage of how do you think about china weve seen president trump called president xi both an enemy and a friend,5
Pete Buttigieg, well the president clearly has no strategy you know when i first got into this race i remember president trump scoffed and said hed like to see me making a deal with xi jinping id like to see him making a deal with xi jinping,5
Pete Buttigieg, is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like april its one more example of a commitment not made when that happens on the international stage people take note not just our competitors our adversaries but also our allies take note of the inability of the united states to keep its word or follow through on its plans and when that happens there are serious consequences,5
Pete Buttigieg, we saw it at the g7 the leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world climate change and there was literally an empty chair where american leadership could have been the problem is this is a moment when american leadership is needed more than ever whether its in hong kong where those protestors for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the united states or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around the world needs america but it cant be just any america ,5
George S, would you repeal the tariffs,5
Pete Buttigieg, i would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage but its not about the tariffs look whats going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire china challenge into a question of of tariffs when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and theres a lack of a bigger strategy,5
George S, senator klobuchar youve actually supported the tariffs on steel,5
Sen Klobuchar, what weve got right now though george its not a focus tariff on steel what he has done here he has assessed these tariffs on our allies he has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos and if we are not careful he is going to bankrupt this country,5
Sen Klobuchar, one forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300000 jobs all right there is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the midwest in my state of minnesota and in iowa so what i think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table thats what i would do i wouldnt have put all these tariffs in place and i wouldnt have had a trade policy where on august 1st he announces hes going to have tariffs on 300 billion of goods on august 13th he cuts it in half a week later he says hes going to reduce taxes the day after that he says hes not going to do it,5
Sen Klobuchar, the leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation and yes we want fair trade but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy which i think means enforcement like weve done in northern minnesota passing bills getting president obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit so we are importing exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things inventing things and exporting to the world he is defeating that goal,5
George S, secretary castro you actually in one of the previous debates identified china as the most serious national security threat to our country i want to pick up on what senator klobuchar was saying that she had said shed go back to the negotiating table the question is what do you do for leverage where do you get it,5
Sec. Castro, well look i agree with those who have said that this erratic haphazard trade war is hurting american families as senator klobuchar said 300000 american jobs its estimated that its cost 600 to the average american family just a couple of days ago 60 of americans said that they believe that were in for a recession next year,5
Sec. Castro, so when i become president i would immediately begin to negotiate with china to ratchet down that trade war we have leverage there i also believe though that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights we have millions of uyghurs for instance in china that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated and in north korea this president is elevating a dictator we need to stop that we need to return to ensuring that america leads again on human rights,5
Sec. Castro, when it comes to this trade war i would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down we have leverage in that discussion,5
George S, senator warren let me bring you in on this conversation president obama signed the transpacific partnership in part it was designed to reign in china to bring china in to some kind of regulation what do you think he got wrong,5
E. Warren, so our trade policy in america has been broken for decades and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else these are giant corporations that shoot if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country theyll do it in a heartbeat and yet for decades now whos been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators who has shaped our trade policy its been the giant corporations its been their lobbyists and their executives,5
E. Warren, the way we change our trade policy in america is first the procedures who sits at the table i want to negotiate trade with unions at the table i want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table i want to negotiate with environmentalists at the table i want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table,5
E. Warren, and you ask the question about leverage if i can just respond to that one the leverage are you kidding everybody wants access to the american market that means that we have the capacity to say right here in america you want to come sell goods to american consumers then youve got to raise your standards youve got to raise your labor standards and youve got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field we can use trade not to undermine american workers and not to undermine american farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country we can use trade to help build a stronger economy,5
George S, senator harris how would your trade policy different from president obamas,5
Kamala Harris, well first of all i have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now which is that weve got a guy in the white house who has been erratic on trade policy he conducts trade policy by tweet frankly born out of his fragile ego it has resulted in farmers in iowa with soy beans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy when we look at this issue my trade policy under a harris administration is always going to be about saying we need to export american products not american jobs and to do that we have to have a meaningful trade policy i am not a protectionist democrat look we need to sell our stuff and that means we need to sell it to people overseas that means we need trade policies that allow that to happen,5
Kamala Harris, you asked earlier about china its a complicated relationship we have to hold china accountable they steal our products including our intellectual property they dump substandard products into our economy they need to be held accountable,5
Kamala Harris, we also need to partner with china on climate and the crisis that that presents we need to partner with china on the issue of north korea i am on and i think the only person on this stage the senate intelligence committee and the senate homeland security committee we need a partner on the issue of north korea but the bottom line is this donald trump in office on trade policy you know he reminds me of that guy in the wizard of oz you know when you pull back the curtain its a really small dude,5
Speaker 1, okay im not even going to take the bait senator harris but i am going to take this to ,5
Bernie Sanders, there is a reason why in the last 45 years the average american today despite an explosion of technology and work or productivity is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago and one of the reasons is that for decades we have had disastrous trade policies,5
Bernie Sanders, and i got to say to my good friend joe biden joe and i strongly disagree on trade i helped lead the opposition to nafta and pntr which cost this country over four million good paying jobs and what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 of what they made in manufacturing,5
Bernie Sanders, so trump obviously hasnt a clue trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three oclock in the morning what we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers represents the farmers in the midwest and elsewhere were losing billions right now because of trumps policy a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in america and goes abroad and then thinks theyre going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract under bernie sanders they got another guess coming,5
George S, vice president biden he invoked your name,5
Joe Biden, yeah well look were either going to make the policy or chinas going to make the rules of the road we make up 25 of the world economy we need another 25 to join us and i think senator warren is correct at the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists,5
Joe Biden, the fact of the matter is china the problem isnt the trade deficit the problem is theyre stealing our intellectual property the problem is theyre violating the wto theyre dumping steel on us thats a different issue than whether or not theyre dumping agricultural products on us,5
Joe Biden, in addition to that were in a position where if we dont set the rules we in fact are going to find ourselves with china setting the rules and thats why you need to organize the world to take on china to stop the corrupt practices that are underway,5
George S, senator booker close out this round,5
Cory Booker, sure,5
Cory Booker, theres one point were really missing on this stage right now which is the fact that donald trumps america first policy is actually an america isolated an america alone policy ,5
Cory Booker, from trade to battling china to the global crisis of climate change the challenges in the middle east he is pulling us away from our allies out of the iran deal out of the paris climate accords and on trade hes deciding to take on china while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies,5
Cory Booker, you literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on canada now look im the only person on the stage that finds trudeaus hair very menacing but they are not a national security threat we cannot go up against china alone this is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like duterte and putin than he does with merkel and macron,5
Cory Booker, we are the strongest nation on the planet earth and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose thats how we beat china thats how we beat climate change on the planet earth and thats how american values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers rights,5
George S, david,5
David, george thank you,5
David, i want to turn now to our troops overseas and to americas longest war in afghanistan us talks with the taliban are dead according to the president secret talks at camp david have been canceled before they could happen many of you have weighed in on that already so i want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail many of you on this stage have said youd bring the troops home in your first term others have said in your first year,5
David, senator warren we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail president obama wanted to bring the troops home president trump promised to bring the troops home and you have said of afghanistan lets help them reach a peace settlement it is time to bring our troops home in your words starting right now would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the taliban,5
E. Warren, yes and ill tell you why what were doing right now in afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the united states it is not helping the safety and security of the world it is not helping the safety and security of afghanistan we need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift we cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily were not going to bomb our way to a solution in afghanistan we need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem and that means we need to be working with all of our allies our european allies our canadian allies our asian allies our allies in africa and in south america we need to work together to root out terrorism it means using all of our tools it means economic investment it means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the state department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries we need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values,5
David, senator warren a quick follow on that because top us leaders military leaders on the ground in afghanistan told me you cant do it without a deal with the taliban you just said you would  you would bring them home what if they told you that would you would listen to their advice,5
E. Warren, i was in afghanistan with john mccain two years ago this past summer i think it may have been senator mccains last trip before he was sick and i talked to people we did we talked to military leaders american and local leaders we talked to people on the ground and ask the question the same one i ask on the senate armed services committee every time one of the generals comes through show me what winning looks like tell me what it looks like and what you hear is a lot of  because no one can describe it and the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military,5
E. Warren, i have three older brothers who all served in the military i understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made they will do anything we ask them to do but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve we need to work with the rest of the world we need to use our economic tools we need to use our diplomatic tools we need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer not keep troops bombing in afghanistan,5
David, senator warren thank you,5
David, i do want to stay on this and im going to turn to mayor buttigieg because youre the only veteran on this stage who served in afghanistan we heard in recent days from general joseph dunford the chair of the joint chiefs of staff who said in recent days im not going to use the word withdrawal right now its our judgment the afghans need support to deal with the level of violence if hes not even using the word withdrawal would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice,5
Pete Buttigieg, you know i served under general dunford way under general dunford in afghanistan and today september 12th 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old old enough to serve and have not been alive on 911 we have got to put an end to endless war and the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be,5
Pete Buttigieg,  that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland and that does not require an openended commitment of ground troops,5
Pete Buttigieg, let me say something else because if theres one thing weve learned about afghanistan  from afghanistan its that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place and so when i am president an authorization for the use of military force will have a builtin threeyear sunset congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to congress to seek an authorization because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas the least our members of congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there,5
Pete Buttigieg, by the way we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props or worse tools for his own enrichment we saw whats going on with flights apparently being routed through scotland just so people can stay at his hotels ill tell you as a military officer the very first thing that goes through your mind the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you were responsible for in uniform is do not let these men and women down this president is doing exactly that i will not,5
David, mayor buttigieg thank you,5
David, i want to turn to vice president biden because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in afghanistan if you pulled the us troops out has been heightened by what weve seen in recent days on the ground in iraq when you were vice president president obama turned to you to bring the troops home from iraq you have said on the campaign trail i made sure the president turned to me and said joe get our combat troops out of iraq there was a major drawdown of us troops and then isis seized by some estimates 40 of the territory in iraq you then had to send thousands of troops back in was it wrong to pull out of iraq that quickly and did the move actually help isis take hold,5
Joe Biden, no it wasnt wrong to pull out but i want to answer the afghanistan question ive been in and out of afghanistan not with a gun and i admire my friend for his service but ive been in and out of afghanistan i think more than anybody on this  and its an open secret you reported a long time ago george that i was opposed to the surge in afghanistan the whole purpose of going to afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency meaning that were going to put that country together it can not be put together let me say it again it will not be put together its three different countries pakistan owns the three counties  the three provinces in the east there are not any part of the  run it i will go on and on,5
Joe Biden, but heres the point the point is that its a counterterrorism strategy we can prevent the united states from being the victim of terror coming out of afghanistan by providing for bases insist the pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from and to move against what we know we dont need those troops there i would bring them home and joe dunfords a fine guy but this has been an internal argument weve had for eight years,5
Joe Biden, with regard to iraq the fact of the matter is that i shouldve never voted to give bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do the aumf was designed he said to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons and when that happened he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof,5
Joe Biden, i said something that was not meant the way i said it i said from that point on what i was argued against in the beginning once he started to put the troops in was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way there was no plan we should not be engaged we didnt have the people with us we didnt have our aligned  we didnt have allies with us etc and it was later when we came into office that barack the president turned to me and said joe  when they said we got to plan to get out he turned to the whole security and said joe will organize this get the troops home,5
Joe Biden, my son spent a year in iraq and i understand and we were right to get the combat troops out the big mistake that was made which we predicted was that you would not have a circumstance where the shia and the kurds would work together to keep isis from moving in now,5
David, mr vice president thank you i want to turn to senator sanders on this because the concern over afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in iraq when the troops came out isis filled that vacuum what do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out us troops too quickly from afghanistan it will create safe haven all over again like the plotters of 911,5
Bernie Sanders, david let me answer that but let me just comment on something that the vice president said you talked about the big mistake in iraq and the surge the truth is the big mistake the huge mistake and one of the big differences between you and me i never believed what cheney and bush said about iraq,5
Joe Biden, youre right,5
Bernie Sanders, i voted against the war in iraq and helped lead the opposition and its sad to say i mean i kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war,5
Bernie Sanders, as the former chairman of the senate committee on veterans affairs i want to pick up on what pete said we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us who have responded to the call of duty but i think also i am the only person up here to have voted against all three of trumps military budgets i dont think we have to spend 750 billion a year on the military when we dont even know who our enemy is,5
Bernie Sanders, i think that what we have got to do is bring this world together bring it together on climate change bring it together in fighting against terrorism and make it clear that we as a planet as a global community well work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism but dropping bombs on afghanistan and iraq was not the way to do it,5
David, senator sanders thank you i want to take this to mr yang you share the stage as you know when we talk about troops in iraq and afghanistan with the vice president who was in the situation room with senators who were on the senate arms services the foreign relations committees with an afghanistan veteran who is on the stage tonight as you share the stage with these candidates what makes you the most qualified on this stage to be commanderinchief,5
Andrew Yang, ive signed a pledge to end the forever wars weve been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years which is not what the american people want we have to start owning what we can and cant do were not very good at rebuilding countries and if you want proof all you have to do is look within our own country at puerto rico weve spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits lost thousands of lives and thank you pete for your service,5
Andrew Yang, and the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made america strong for decades i would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment what the american people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harms way and thats what i would do as president,5
David, mr yang thank you jorge,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you very much  you havent been asked about latin america in the previous debates so lets begin senator sanders one country where many immigrants are arriving from is venezuela a recent un factfinding mission found that thousands have been disappeared tortured and killed by government forces in venezuela you admit that venezuela does not have free elections but still you refuse to call nicolas maduro un dictador a dictator can you explain why and what are the main differences between your kind of socialism and the one being imposed in venezuela cuba and nicaragua,5
Bernie Sanders, well first of all let me be very clear anybody who does what maduro does is a vicious tyrant what we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future,5
Bernie Sanders, in terms of democratic socialism to equate what goes on in venezuela with what i believe is extremely unfair ill tell you what i believe in terms of democratic socialism i agree with what goes on in canada and in scandinavia guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right i believe that the united states should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave i believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement,5
Bernie Sanders, i happen to believe also that what to me democratic socialism means is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough jorge not in the media and not in congress you got three people in america owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country you got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in wall street the insurance companies and in the media maybe just  maybe what we should be doing,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you,5
Bernie Sanders,  is creating an economy that works for all of us not 1 thats my understanding of democratic socialism,5
Jorge Ramos,  you wanted to say a quick response 45 seconds,5
Sec. Castro, sure thank you jorge ill call maduro a dictator because he is a dictator and what we need to do is to along with our allies make sure that the venezuelan people get the assistance that they need that we continue to pressure venezuela so that theyll have free and fair elections and also here in the united states offer a temporary protected status tps to venezuelans that is something that the trump administration has failed to do for all of his big talk about supporting the venezuelanamerican community he has failed i will not,5
Sec. Castro, i also believe that we need to do things like a 21stcentury marshall plan for honduras el salvador and guatemala so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the united states and under my administration were going to put renewed focus on latin america it makes sense theyre our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you,5
Sec. Castro, it also makes sense that because we have a country like china that is going around the world to places like africa and latin america making their own relationships strengthening those the united states needs to strengthen its partnerships in latin america immediately,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you ,5
Sec. Castro, and i will,5
Jorge Ramos, senator booker let me ask you about brazil after the recent fires in the amazon some experts suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment you are a vegan since 2014 thats obviously a personal choice but president trump and brazils president bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth so should more americans including those here in texas and in iowa follow your diet,5
Cory Booker, first of all i want to say no actually i want to translate that into spanish no look lets just be clear the factory farming going on thats assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry one of the reasons why i have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment and you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that dont line up with our values thats what im calling for,5
Cory Booker, but i want to switch because we dont have  a crowded debate stage we were talking about afghanistan and iraq it annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didnt say one word about veterans in our country we have a shameful reality in america that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds hurts and harms theyre disproportionately homeless you hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the va it is very important that we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us we end our national anthem with home of the brave its about time we make this a better home for our bravest,5
Jorge Ramos, congressman orourke hurricane harvey hit this town two years ago and not only is the amazon burning greenland is melting at a record pace the last five years have been the hottest ever recorded and we have a viewers question about this what meaningful action will you take to reverse the effect of climate change and can we count on you to follow through if your donors are against it,5
Beto O’Rourke, yes we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it we will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050 that we are halfway there by 2030 that we mobilize 5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that that we invest here in houston texas with predisaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding given the fact that this town has seen three 500year floods in just five years youd like to think youre good for 1500 years but youre not theyre coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever,5
Beto O’Rourke, were also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology as well as the highpaying highskill highwage jobs that come along with that and then were going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide planting cover crops keeping more land under conservation using notill farming regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil thats the way that were going to meet this challenge and were going to bring everyone into the solution,5
Jorge Ramos, many of you want to comment lets try to see if we can go very fast senator klobuchar,5
Sen Klobuchar, thank you this is the existential crisis of our time you know that movie the day after tomorrow its today we have seen a warming in our world like never before were seeing flooding in the midwest flooding in houston fires in the west and i think having someone leading the ticket from the midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done,5
Sen Klobuchar, on day one i will get us back into the international climate change agreement on day two i will bring back the clean power rules that president obama had worked on on day three i will bring back the gas mileage standards you can do all that without congress which is good on day four five and six i will working with congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you,5
Sen Klobuchar, and on day seven youre supposed to rest but i wont,5
Jorge Ramos, senator warren,5
Sen Klobuchar, this is what we need to do if were going to get at climate change we have to take this on as a crisis thats happening right now,5
Jorge Ramos, senator warren should american foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change,5
E. Warren, yes we need to work on every front on climate change it is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time every time the scientists go back they say we have less and less time than we thought we had but that means weve got to use all the tools one of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools i have proposed following governor inslee that we by 2028 cut all carbon emissions from new buildings by 2030 carbon emissions from cars and by 2035 all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity that alone those three will cut our emissions here in the united states by 70 we can do this,5
E. Warren, we also need to help around the world to clean but understand this one more time why doesnt it happen,5
Jorge Ramos, thank you,5
E. Warren, as long as washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future we cant make the changes we need to make we have to attack the corruption head on so that we can save our planet,5
Jorge Ramos, senator harris 45 seconds,5
Kamala Harris, when i think about this issue it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one and a half and three years old when i look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing when they turn 20 i am really scared and when ive been in the united states senate for now the last two and a half years and i look at our counterparts the republicans in the united states senate they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror i dont know what they see but its a lack of courage,5
Kamala Harris, and this is an issue that yes it represents an existential threat it is also something we can do something about this is a problem that was created by human behaviors and we can change our behaviors in a way that,5
Kamala Harris,  and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet ive seen it happen in california i took on as the attorney general of california i ran the second largest department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice i took on the big oil companies we saw progress,5
Kamala Harris, if any of you have been to los angeles  20 years ago youll remember that sky was brown you go there now the sky is blue you know why because leader decided to lead we took on these big fossil fuel companies we have some of the most important and strongest laws,5
Speaker 2, thank you,5
Kamala Harris,  in the country,5
Speaker 2, thank you very much,5
Kamala Harris, we made a difference my point being ive done it before and i will lead as president on this issue because we have no time the clock is ticking,5
Speaker 2, thank you,5
Kamala Harris,   but we need courage and we need courageous leadership we can get this done,5
Speaker 2, mr yang,5
Andrew Yang, to follow up on what elizabeth said why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies why are we losing to the gun lobby and the nra the answer is this we all know everyone on this stage knows that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests now everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests but we have to face facts money finds a way money will find its way back in,5
Andrew Yang, what is the answer the answer is to wash the money out with people powered money my proposal is that we give every american 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like this would washout the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one that is the only way we will win as someone running for president ill tell you theres the people on one side and the money on the other the only way for us to win is if we bring them together,5
Speaker 2, thank you mr yang,5
Speaker 2, ,5
Lindsey, id like to have an academic discussion now about education mr yang well stay with you here in houston the school district is facing yet another year of spending cuts like schools across the country the system faces many challenges one of them thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools you are the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools,5
Lindsey, you have said that democrats who want to limit them are quote just jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice why isnt tax payer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools,5
Andrew Yang, let me be clear i am pro good school ive got a kid  one of my little boys just started public school last week and i was not there because i was running for president we need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold we need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human word,5
Andrew Yang, but heres the big one the data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school were talking about time spent at home with the parents words read to them when theyre young stress levels in the house income type of neighborhood were putting money into schools and educators know this were saying youre 100 responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30 they all know this the answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach,5
Lindsey, mayor buttigieg 45 seconds to respond,5
Pete Buttigieg, step one is appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education i believe in public education in order to strengthen it some things are very complex for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips but we got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning some of it is extremely simple weve just got to pay teachers more weve got to lift up the teaching profession,5
Pete Buttigieg, i always think of a story from south bend of friends who hosted exchange students from japan they had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher they kept in touch with her when she went back to japan and to college she took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well she came up just short you know what she did since she was academically good but couldnt quite make the cut to be a teacher she had a fallback plan she became a doctor that is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession,5
Pete Buttigieg, if we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors,5
Lindsey, senator warren to use mr yangs term are you just jumping into bed with teachers unions,5
E. Warren, i think im the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher ive wanted to be a public school teacher since i was in 2nd grade lets be clear in all the ways we talk about this money for public schools should stay in public schools not go anywhere else ive already made my commitment we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher,5
E. Warren, i think this is ultimately about our values i have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 110 of 1 in this country that would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five universal prek for every three year old and four year old in this country,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
E. Warren, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country cancel student loan debt for 95 of the folks whove got it,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
E. Warren, strengthen our unions this is how we build an america that reflects our values not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives,5
Lindsey, senator harris 45 seconds to respond,5
Kamala Harris, my first grade teacher mrs francis wilson god rest her soul attended my law school graduation i think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us i have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this which will be the first in the nation federal investment enclosing the teacher pay gap which is 13500 a year because right now in our public schools our teachers 94 of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies that is wrong,5
Kamala Harris, i also want to talk about where we are here at tsu and what it means in terms of hbcus i have as part of my proposal that we will put two trillion dollars into investing in our hbcus for teachers because one as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university i will say that is our hbcus that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions but also,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
Kamala Harris, but this is a critical point if a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13 more likely to go to college if that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32 more likely to go to college when we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much when we fix it that will fix so many other things we must invest in the potential,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
Kamala Harris,  of our children,5
Lindsey, senator sanders,5
Kamala Harris, i strongly believe you can judge a  society based on how it treats its children and we are,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
Kamala Harris,  failing on this issue,5
Bernie Sanders, guess what youre guessing all right heres the answer we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth we have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they cant work two or three jobs to support themselves which is why under my legislation well move to see that every teacher in america makes at least 60000 a year,5
Bernie Sanders, what we will also do is not only have universal prek we will make public colleges and universities and hbcus debt free what we will also do because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need we are going to cancel all student debt in this country,5
Lindsey, thank you senator thank you,5
Bernie Sanders, we are going to do that by imposing a tax on wall street speculation,5
Lindsey, thank you  senator mr vice president i want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race in a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975 you told a reporter i dont feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather i feel responsible for what the situation is today for the sins of my own generation ill be damned if i feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago you said that some 40 years ago but as you stand here tonight what responsibility do you think that americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country,5
Joe Biden, well they have to deal with the  look there is institutional segregation in this country from the time i got involved i started dealing with that redlining banks making sure that we are in a position where  look we talk about education i propose that what we take is those very poor schools the title 1 schools triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year give every single teacher a raise so they equal raise of getting out of the 60000 level,5
Joe Biden, number two make sure that we bring into help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home the problems that come from home we have one school psychologist for every 1500 kids in america today its crazy the teachers are  im married to a teacher my deceased wife is a teacher they have every problem coming to them we make sure that every single child does in fact have three four and five year olds go to school school not daycare school we bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,5
Joe Biden, its not that they dont want to help they dont know quite what to do play the radio make sure the television  excuse me make sure you have the record player on at night make sure the kids hear words a kid coming from a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there theres so much we can,5
Lindsey, thank you mr vice president,5
Joe Biden, no im going to go like the rest of them do twice over okay because heres the deal the deal is that weve got this a little backwards,5
Joe Biden, by the way in venezuela we should be allowing people to come here from venezuela i know maduro ive confronted maduro,5
Joe Biden, number two you talk about the need to do something to latin america im the guy that came up with 740 million dollars to see to it those three countries in fact changed their system so people dont have a chance to leave youre all acting like we just discovered this yesterday thank you very much,5
Lindsey, thank you mr vice president,5
Lindsey, secretary castro,5
Sec. Castro, thank you very much well thats quite a lot  but i grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about in a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation in fact in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 supreme court case challenging how texas financed its schools,5
Sec. Castro, i know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated now i have an education plan like a lot of folks up here that would pay teachers more that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers that would invest in our public schools but i also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity to invest in job opportunity to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their ged healthcare opportunities those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper those are the types of things we need to do in addition to lifting up our public schools,5
Sec. Castro, you asked a second ago about charter schools look it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools theyre not,5
Lindsey, thank you secretary,5
Sec. Castro, well im not categorically against charter schools i would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now,5
Lindsey, senator booker coming to you know it was 65 years ago this year that the supreme court outlawed racial segregation in public schools yet for millions of students of color today segregation remains a reality nonwhite districts typically receive 2200 less per student than those in white districts this means older books less access to computers and often worse outcomes what is your plan to address segregation im not just talking about the achievement gap but im talking about the opportunity gap in education,5
Cory Booker, im hearing a lot of conversations on the stage and the way we talk about communities of color look i live in a black and brown community below the poverty line ive lived in  housing projects for almost a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they dont have a school that serves their genius i think im the only person on the stage even though i had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system i stepped up and took responsibility for our schools we produce results,5
Cory Booker, a lot of folks here talking about raising teachers salary we actually did it in newark new jersey we didnt stop there we closed poor performing charter schools but dagnabbit we expanded high performing charter schools we were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community the results speak for themselves were now the number one city in america for beat the odds schools from high poverty to high performance strategies like investing in our children work,5
Cory Booker, ill tell you this i am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated disconnected from the other issues thats why my friend secretary castro is 100 right we are in the reality we are right now because vice president of overtly racist policies not 400 years ago just in my lifetime that were redlining communities disinvesting in communities more than just that my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools but theyre also struggling with environmental injustice if youve talked to someone whos a parent of a child who has had permanent brain damage because of lead youll know this is a national problem because theres over 3000 jurisdictions in america where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of flint michigan,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
Cory Booker, if im president of the united states it is a holistic solution to education from raising teachers salary fully funded special education but combating the issues of poverty combating the issues of racial segregation combating the issues of a criminal justice system that takes,5
Lindsey, thank you senator,5
Cory Booker,  parents away from their kids dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy,5
Speaker 3,  thank you lindsey one final question coming up well be right back,5
George S.,  a round of questions one question for each candidate were going to go in reverse order from the opening statement and the candidates the question is on the quality of resilience no president can succeed without resilience every president confronts crises defeats and mistakes so i want to ask each of you whats the most significant professional setback youve had to face how did you recover from it and what did you learn from it vice president biden,5
Joe Biden, i never counted any professional setback i have as a serious setback theres things that are important things that arent important,5
George S., were going to clear the protestors now just one minute,5
George S., senator biden well start the clock again,5
Speaker 3, ,5
Joe Biden, whatd they say,5
Joe Biden, im sorry,5
George S., were sorry go ahead,5
Joe Biden, there are setbacks to the setbacks and i think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose  well my dad had an expression he said joey its not a question of succeeding and whether you get knocked down its how quickly you get up he used to say you never explain and never complain then go on to say that the only obligation that really matters the most important thing is family,5
Joe Biden, so i was raised to believe that that was the center of everything family and could be judged on based how you treat your family and how you went from there it took  you know kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark,5
Joe Biden, right after i got elected my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident and my two sons were badly injured id just been elected not sworn in i lost my faith for awhile i came back then later when my son beau came home from iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later a year and a half later losing him was like losing part of my soul the fact is that i learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose purpose in what you do,5
Joe Biden, thats why i hope hes proud of me today because he wanted to make sure i didnt run for president but i stayed engaged because when you get hit badly whether youre losing a job or youre raising a family like my dad where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you cant live here anymore dad lost his job you know weve all been through that some form or another it just takes  just for me the way ive dealt with it is finding purpose my purpose is to do what ive always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy,5
Joe Biden, theres a lot of people who went through a lot worse than i have and get up every single morning put their feet one foot in front of another without the help i had there are real heroes out there some real heroes,5
George S., thank you mister vice president senator warren,5
Elizabeth W., i mentioned earlier ive known what i wanted to be since second grade i wanted to be a public school teacher and i invested early i used to line my dollies up and teach school i had a reputation for being tough but fair by the time i graduated from high school my family didnt have money for a college application much less to send me off to four years at a university,5
Elizabeth W., my story like a lot of stories has a lot of twists and turns i got a scholarship then at 19 i got married dropped out of school took a minimum wage job thought my dream was over i got a chance down the road at the university of houston and i made it as a special needs teacher i still remember that first year as a special needs teacher i could tell you what those babies looked like i had four to six year olds,5
Elizabeth W., at the end of that first year i was visibly pregnant back in the day that meant that the principal said to me  wished me luck and hired someone else for the job so there i am im at home ive got a baby i cant have a job what am i going to do heres resilience i said ill go to law school the consequence was i practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love which is teaching it let me get into fights it gave me new tools the reason im standing here today is because i got back up i fought back i know whats broken i want to be in the fight to fix it in america,5
George S., thank you senator,5
Elizabeth W., thats why im here,5
George S., senator sanders,5
Bernie Sanders, id say that resilience to me means growing up in a rent controlled apartment in brooklyn new york the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket professional resilience means to me george running for us senate in vermont and getting one percent of the vote running for governor and getting two percent of the vote finally becoming mayor of burlington vermont with ten vote margin,5
Bernie Sanders, what resilience means to me is that throughout my political career i have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country whether it is wall street whether it is the insurance industry whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex i feel confident that given a lifelong record ive taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country that i will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that works for all of us not just the one percent,5
George S., thank you senator sanders senator harris,5
Kamala Harris, every office ive run for whether it be district attorney or attorney general i was told each time it cant be done they said nobody like you has done it before youre  nobody is ready for you when i ran for da i won and became the first black woman elected da in a state of 40 million people in san francisco when i ran for attorney general of california i was elected because i didnt listen i was the only black elected woman black elected attorney general in the state in the country,5
Kamala Harris, each time people would say its not your time its not your turn its going to be too difficult theyre not ready for you i didnt listen a part of it probably comes from the fact that i was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me including dont you ever let anybody tell you who you are you tell them who you are,5
Kamala Harris, when i look around the town halls that we do in this race for president of the united states and i look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings and i see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers they bring them to me and i talk to them during these events and they smile theyre full of joy and their fathers tell them see dont you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be you have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been,5
George S., senator harris thank you very much mayor buttigieg,5
Pete Buttigieg, as a military officer serving under dont ask dont tell and as an elected official in the state of indiana when mike pence was governor at a certain point when it came to professional setbacks i had to wonder whether just acknowledging who i was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback i came back from deployment and realized that you only get to live one life and i was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer so i just came out i had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community,5
Pete Buttigieg, what happened was that when i trusted voters to judge me based on the job that i did for them they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80 of the vote what i learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know whats worth more to you than winning i think thats what we need in the presidency right now we have to know what we are about,5
Pete Buttigieg, this election is not about any of us up here it is not about this president even though its hard to talk of anything else some days its about the people who trust us with their lives a kid wondering if were actually going to make their schools safe when theyve learned active shooter drills before theyve learned to read a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change if we hold to that then it doesnt matter what happens to each of us professionally together we will win a better era for our country,5
George S., mayor buttigieg thank you mister yang,5
Andrew Yang, i was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and i left to start a business im going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship if you want to start something tell everyone you know youre going to do it then you dont have a choice you put your heart and soul into it even though i did that my company flopped had its mini rise and maximum fall lost investors hundreds of thousands of dollars still owed 100000 in school debt my parents still told people i was a lawyer i guess it was a little easier,5
Andrew Yang, so i remember lying on my floor looking up wondering how did it come to this eventually i picked myself back up i kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success then after i did have some success i still remembered how hard it was how isolating it was how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you so i spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country including sean wen whos here in the audience tonight who left his gilded wall street job to become a food entrepreneur in san antonio sean i hope i made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations,5
George S., thank you thank you mister yang senator booker,5
Cory Booker, my biggest professional setback is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it i with a bunch of tenant leaders in newark new jersey in 2002 took on the political machine boy did they fight back i had tires on my car slashed our campaign offices were broken into my phones were tapped it became a spectacle and we lost that election heres a bit of advice to everybody if youre going to have a spectacular failure have a documentary team there to capture it because it made for an oscar nominated documentary called street fight but hen unfortunately another setback it lost in the oscars to a movie called march of the dag nab penguins for crying out loud,5
Cory Booker, the people in my community of living in the projects told me dont give up on the people and the people wont give up on you create bigger and bolder coalitions and youre going to win you know what we came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our citys history,5
Cory Booker, more than that the lesson was there we didnt give up we were taking on americas toughest problems from crime to poverty we transformed our city creating tens of thousands of new jobs the biggest economic expansion in our city and as i said before turned around our school system theres more work to do but i havent given up on the people i still live in that community,5
Cory Booker, this is the big lesson my staff and my friends and my community told me if you want to go fast you may have won the mayors race but thats not what life is about theres an old african saying that says if you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go together the lesson i learned of resilience is to trust people because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power the test of america right now its not a referendum on donald trump its a referendum on us and who we are and who were going to be together we need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose and then theres nothing we cant do together as a nation,5
George S., senator booker thank you congressman orourke,5
Beto O’Rourke, thank you george everything that ive learned about resilience ive learned from my hometown of el paso texas in the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the president of the united states that killed 22 people and injured many more we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that the very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country we dont see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous we see them as foundational to our success to our strength and to our security and to our safety,5
Beto O’Rourke, yesterday i was visiting with one of those victims hes the head coach of the fusion this is a girls soccer team of ten and 11 year old girls his name is luis he was shot in the legs multiple times he was shot in the side multiple times hes still healing from his wounds in the hospital but from his hospital bed hes still trying to coach the fusion girls soccer team memo his cocoach is still fighting for his life right now at del sol hospital those two men jessica and marcella their wives they exemplify resilience to me,5
Beto O’Rourke, when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country when we finally confront the racism that exists in america when were defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions it will be in large part i think thanks to the example that el paso has set,5
George S., congressman thank you,5
Beto O’Rourke, thank you,5
George S., senator klobuchar,5
Amy Klobuchar, my challenges and resilience have brought me up here i grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life after his third dwi he had a choice between jail and treatment he chose treatment with his faith with his friends with our family in his words he was pursued by grace that made me interested in public service because i feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace then got married my husbands out there somewhere hopefully smiling and our daughter our daughter was born i had this expectation we were going to have this perfect perfect birth she was really sick and she couldnt swallow she was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half but when she was born they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours she was in intensive care and i was kicked out i thought this could never happen to any other mom again,5
Amy Klobuchar, so i went to the legislature our state legislator not an elected official a mom and i advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay when they tried to delay the implementation of that law i brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyist two to one when they said when should it take place they all raised their hand and said now,5
Amy Klobuchar, that is what motivated me to go into public service when i got to that gridlock of washington dc and got to work and pass over a hundred bills  i know a lot of my friends here are from the left but remember i am from the middle of the country i believe if were going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit someones going to not just change the policies but change the tone in the country and someone who believes in america and believes it from their heart because of where they came from that everyone should have that same opportunity,5
George S., senator thank you secretary castro,5
Julian Castro, thank you george to hold head to linsey and to david and to all of you all for tuning in tonight in many ways i shouldnt be here on this stage castro is my mothers name and was my grandmothers name before her i grew up in a single parent household on the west side of san antonio going to the public schools eventually my brother joaquin and i became the first in our family to become professionals,5
Julian Castro, when i got home i took a job at the biggest law firm in town i was making 100000 a year in the year 2000 a few months later i got elected to the san antonio city council the city council at the time was only paying 1040 a year so everybody had another job and my job was at the law firm well a few months after i got elected the law firm got a client the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal the land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply because we relied on an underground aquifer i didnt think the environmental protection plan was strong enough so i wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it but under the ethics rules for lawyers in texas because believe it or not lawyers have ethics rules you cant just go against the interests of a client so i was stuck,5
Julian Castro, on the one hand i wanted to do the right thing on the other hand my livelihood my student loans my new house payment my car payment depended on me shutting up being conflicted out so one day i walked into my law firm and i quit my job and then i went and i voted against that land deal on the city council,5
Julian Castro, it was the first test that i had i think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics is dirty or corrupting i wondered before i went into it whether it would change who i was i was proud that when that first test came that i stood up for the people that i was there to represent and not for big special interests theres nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the united states this president has failed that test but i want you to know that if you elect me president i wont i wont serve anybody except you and your family together we can create an america thats better than ever thank you very much,5
George S., secretary castro thank you to all of our candidates it was a great debate i think we learned a lot tonight thanks to you thanks to texas southern university for hosting us tonight it was a great crowd,5
Speaker 13, thank you,5
George S.,  tonight thanks to you thanks to everyone at home the debate is over our coverage continues with tom llamas thats it,5
Anderson Cooper, its the cnn new york times democratic presidential debate we want to welcome our viewers in the united states and watching around the world watching us on cnn cnn international cnn espanol cnncom thenewyorktimescom cnn cnns facebook page and listening on the westworld one radio network sirius xm satellite radio npr and the american forces network im anderson cooper moderating tonights debate along with cnns erin burnett and new york times national editor marc lacey we are in ohio tonight because its one of the most critical battleground states ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896,6
Erin Burnett, the top 12 democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums this is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate so to accommodate the large group there are no opening statements tonight,6
Marc Lacey, before we begin a reminder of the ground rules youll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 seconds for clarifications please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time,6
Anderson Cooper, and we remind our audience here in the rike center at otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other all right lets begin since the last debate house democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against president trump which all the candidates on this stage support senator warren i want to start with you you have said that theres already enough evidence for president trump to be impeached and removed from office but the question is with the election only one year away why shouldnt it be the voters who determine the presidents fate,6
Senator Warren, because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and i think thats the case with this impeachment inquiry when i made the decision to run for president i certainly didnt think it was going to be about impeachment but when the mueller report came out i read it all 442 pages and when i got to the end i realized that mueller had shown to a fare thee well that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly and so at that moment i called for opening an impeachment inquiry now that didnt happen and look what happened as a result donald trump broke the law again in the summer broke it again this fall you know we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the president of the united states impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences this is about donald trump but understand its about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country the impeachment must go forward,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator warren youre all going to get in on this by the way senator sanders do democrats have any choice but to impeach president trump please respond,6
Bernie Sanders, no they dont in my judgment trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country its not just that he obstructed justice with the mueller report i think that the house will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause this is a president who is enriching himself while using the oval office to do that and that is outrageous and i think in terms of the recent ukrainian incident the idea that we have a president of the united states who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension so i look forward by the way not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process but mitch mcconnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the senate,6
Anderson Cooper, vice president biden during the clinton impeachment proceedings you said and i quote the american people dont think that theyve made a mistake by electing bill clinton and we in congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision with the country now split have democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of president trump,6
Joe Biden, yes they have i said from the beginning that if in fact trump continued to stonewall what the congress is entitled to know about his background what he did all the accusations in the mueller report if they did that they would have no choice no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding which gives them more power to seek more information this president and i agree with bernie senator sanders is the most corrupt president in modern history and i think all of our history and the fact is that this president of united states has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all will not list any witnesses will not provide information will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment they have no choice but to move,6
Anderson Cooper, senator harris house speaker nancy pelosi has said that members of congress have to be in her words fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself youve already said that based on everything youve seen you would vote to remove him from office is that being fair to the president,6
Kamala Harris, well its just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight i mean its shocking but he told us who he was maya angelou who told us years ago listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time during that election donald trump told us he could shoot somebody on fifth avenue and get away with it and he has consistently since he won been selling out the american people hes been selling out working people hes been selling out our values hes been selling out national security and on this issue with ukraine hes been selling out our democracy our framers imagined this moment a moment where we would have a corrupt president and our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances this is one of those moments and so congress must ask but the reality of it is that i dont really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor i know a confession when i see it,6
Kamala Harris, and and he did it in plain sight he has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt this will not take very long donald trump needs to be held accountable he is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had,6
Anderson Cooper, senator booker you have said that president trumps moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president can you be fair in an impeachment trial please respond,6
Senator Booker, so first of all we must be fair we are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office this has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship look i share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage i understand the outrage that we all feel but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable that brings our country together doesnt rip us apart anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the american public that works to build consensus thats what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one so i swore an oath to do my job as a senator do my duty this president has violated his i will do mine,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator booker senator klobuchar what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact peoples day to day lives healthcare the economy and could backfire on democrats,6
Amy Klobuchar, we can do two things at once thats our job we have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment but we also can stand up for america because this president has not been putting america in front of his own personal interests he has not been standing up for the workers of ohio hes not been standing up for the farmers in iowa and i take this even a step further you know when he made that call to the head of ukraine hes digging up dirt on an opponent thats illegal conduct thats what he was doing he didnt talk to them about the russian invasion he talked to him about that so im still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes america great again id like to hear from him about how leaving the kurds for slaughter our allies for slaughter where russia then steps in to protect them how that makes america great again,6
Amy Klobuchar, and i would like to hear from him about how coddling up to vladimir putin makes america great again it doesnt make america great again it makes russia great again and that is what this president has done so whether it is workers issues whether it is farmers issue he has put his own private interests and i will not do that,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you secretary castro is impeachment of distraction,6
Julian Castro, not at all we can walk and chew gum at the same time and all of us are out there every single day talking about what were going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage that more families have great healthcare that more folks are put to work in places like ohio where donald trump has broken his promises because ohio michigan and pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs not gained them not only that what we have to recognize is that not only did the mueller report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to and he made that call to president zelensky of the ukraine but he is ongoingly in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power we have to impeach this president and the majority of americans not only support impeachment they support removal he should be removed,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan theres been obviously very little republican support to date yet democrats are proceeding is that a mistake,6
Pete Buttigieg, well its a mistake on the part of republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share look the president has left the congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the president accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations but actions that he has confessed to on television its also about the presidency itself because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything but everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the trump presidency remember one way or the other this presidency is going to come to an end i want you to picture what its going to be like what its actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after donald trump has been president,6
Pete Buttigieg, it starts out feeling like a happy thought this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over but really think about where well be vulnerable even more torn apart by politics than we are right now and these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process im running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mr mayor congresswoman gabbard youre the only sitting house member on this stage how do you respond,6
Tulsi Gabbard, if impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests it will only further divide an already terribly divided country unfortunately this is what weve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after trump won his election and as unhappy as that may make us as democrats he won that election in 2016 the serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the house and i think that it should continue to play its course out together all the information provide that to the american people recognizing that that is the only way forward if the house votes to impeach the senate does not vote to remove donald trump he walks out and he feels exonerated further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congresswoman mr steyer youve been calling for impeachment for two years does there need to be bipartisan support,6
Tom Steyer, well anderson this is my first time on this stage so i just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the white house but i also want to point out that andersons right two years ago i started the need to impeach movement because i knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 pennsylvania avenue that we did have the most corrupt president in the country and that only the voice and the will of the american people would drag washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong not of political expediency so in fact impeaching and removing this president is something that the american people are demanding theyre the voice that counts and thats who i went to the american people,6
Anderson Cooper, mr yang do you think theres already enough evidence out there to impeach the president please respond,6
Andrew Yang, i support impeachment but we shouldnt have any illusions that impeaching donald trump will one be successful or two erase the problems that got him elected in 2016 were standing in the great state of ohio the ultimate purple state the ultimate bellwether state why did donald trump win your state by eight points because we got rid of 300000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and were not stopping there how many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in ohio raise your hands its not just you amazon alone as closing 30 of americas stores in malls soaking up 20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes these are the problems that got donald trump elected the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the oval office the fact is donald trump when were talking about him we are losing we need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching donald trump,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman orourke on impeachment please respond,6
Beto O’Rourke, you know i think about everyone whos ever served this country in uniform we have two examples here on the stage tonight mayor buttigieg and congresswoman gabbard those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution we are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this presidents criminality and his lawlessness the fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land he invited the participation the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy as president he lied to investigators obstructed justice fired james comey head of the fbi tried to fire mueller head of the investigation then invited president zelensky to involve himself in our politics as well as china in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congressman,6
Beto O’Rourke, if you do not hold them to account if there is not justice not only have we failed this moment our constitution and our country we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congressman the impeachment inquiry is centered on president trumps attempts to get political dirt from ukraine on vice president biden and his son hunter mr vice president president trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in ukraine i want to point out there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you having said that on sunday you announced that if youre president no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses my question is if its not okay for a presidents family to be involved in foreign businesses why was it okay for your son when you were vice president vice president biden,6
Joe Biden, look my son did nothing wrong i did nothing wrong i carried out the policy of the united states government in rooting out corruption in ukraine and thats what we should be focusing on and what i wanted to make a point about and my sons statement speaks for itself he spoke about it today my sons statement speaks for itself what i think is important is we focus on why its so important to remove this man from office on the 17th  look the fact that george washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections it was the greatest threat to america,6
Joe Biden, this president on three occasions three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections the fact is that it is outrageous rudy giuliani the president and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying what we have to do now is focus on donald trump he doesnt want me to be the candidate hes going after me because he knows if i get the nomination i will beat him like a drum,6
Anderson Cooper, hold on im sorry i just want follow up mr vice president as youve said to your son hunter today gave an interview he admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in ukraine did you make a mistake by letting him you were the point person on ukraine at the time if you can answer,6
Joe Biden, look my sons statement speaks for itself i did my job i never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with ukraine no one has indicated i have weve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of delaware we never discussed any so thered be no potential conflict my son made a judgment im proud of the judgment he made im proud of what he had to say and lets focus on this the fact of the matter is that this is about trumps corruption thats what we should be focusing on,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders your response,6
Bernie Sanders, let me make a point i think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment i hope that he is impeached but i think what would be a disaster if the american people believed that all we were doing is taking on trump and were forgetting that 87 million americans are uninsured or under insured were forgetting about the existential threat of climate change we are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck so what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way but we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders thank you mark,6
Marc Lacey, we want to move now now to the economy senator warren  thank you,6
Senator Booker, it is wrong to move on,6
Marc Lacey, senator warren youve proposed some sweeping plans free public college free universal child care eliminating most americans college debt and youve said how youre going to pay for those plans but you have not specified how youre going to pay for the most expensive plan medicare for all will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it yes or no,6
Senator Warren, so i have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking middle class families costs will go down you know the way i see this is i have been out all around this country ive done 140 town halls now been to 27 states and puerto rico shoot i have done 70000 selfies which must be the new measure of democracy and this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly so ive talked with the family the mom and dad whose daughters been diagnosed with cancer i have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes ive talked to the young man who has ms and heres the thing about all of them they all had great health insurance right at the beginning but then they found out when they really needed it when the costs went up that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing,6
Senator Warren, look the way i see this it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer to think about the changes in your family if your moms got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if youve been diagnosed with ms but what you shouldnt have to worry about is how youre going to pay for your healthcare after that,6
Marc Lacey, senator warren to be clear senator sanders acknowledges hes going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for medicare for all youve endorsed his plan should you acknowledge it too,6
Senator Warren, so the way i see this it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face so let me be clear on this costs will go up for the wealthy they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families they will go down i will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families,6
Marc Lacey, mayor buttigieg you say senator warren has been evasive about how shes going to pay for medicare for all whats your response,6
Pete Buttigieg, well we heard it tonight a yes or no question that didnt get a yes or no answer this is why people here in the midwest are so frustrated with washington in general and capitol hill in particular your signature senator is to have a plan for everything except this no plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion dollar hole in this medicare for all plan that senator warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in and the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every american and move forward with the boldest biggest transformation since the inception of medicare itself but the way to do it without a giant multitrillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is medicare for all who want it we take a version of medicare we let you access it if you want to and if you prefer to stay on your private plan you can do that too that is what most americans want medicare for all who want it trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family and it can be delivered without ,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mayor senator your response,6
Senator Warren, so lets be clear whenever someone hears the term medicare for all who want it understand what that really means its medicare for all who can afford it and thats the problem weve got medicare for all is the gold standard it is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single american including the family whose childs been diagnosed with cancer including the person whos just gotten an ms diagnosis thats how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare we can pay for this ive laid out the basic principles costs are going to go up for the wealthy theyre going to go up for big corporations they will not go up for middle class families and i will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about ive been studying this for the biggest part of my life why people go bankrupt,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator can the mayor respond,6
Senator Warren, sure,6
Pete Buttigieg, i dont think the american people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of medicare for all who want it which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place allows you to get that healthcare its just better than medicare for all whether you want it or not and i dont understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans kicking 150 million americans off of their insurance in four short years when we could achieve that same big bold goal and once again were competing to be president for the day after trump our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now after everything weve been through after everything we are about to go through this country will be even more divided why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when theres a better way to deliver coverage for all,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mayor senator sanders,6
Senator Warren, id like to be able to respond,6
Bernie Sanders, as somebody who wrote the damn bill as i said lets be clear on the medicare for all bill that i wrote premiums are gone copayments are gone deductibles are gone all out of pocket expenses are gone were going to do better than the canadians doing that is what they have managed to do at the end of the day the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills but i do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up theyre going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody the tax increase they pay will be substantially less substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses,6
Marc Lacey,  senator warren will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up,6
Senator Warren, my view on this and what i have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families i will not embrace a plan like medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot and i will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says sorry were not covering your expensive cancer treatments were not covering your expensive treatments for ms were not covering what covering what you need,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator senator klobuchar,6
Amy Klobuchar, at least bernies being honest here and saying how hes going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and im sorry elizabeth but you have not said that and i think we owe it to the american people to tell them where were going to send the invoice i believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash obamacare but to do exactly what barack obama wanted to do from the beginning and thats have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies that is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years and im tired of hearing whenever i say these things oh its republican talking points you are making republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan thats going to do that i think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and its the one we should get behind,6
Marc Lacey, senator warren,6
Senator Warren, yeah i didnt spend most of my time in washington i spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke and one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare and back when i was studying it two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance the problem weve got right now is the overall cost of healthcare and look you can try to spin this any way you want ive spent my entire life on working on how americas middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back i put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an america that works and a part of that is weve got stop americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator senator klobuchar do you want to respond,6
Amy Klobuchar, yes i do and i appreciate elizabeths work but again the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices but what really bothers me about this discussion which weve had so many times is that we dont talk about the things that im hearing about from regular americans that is longterm care we are seeing i once called it a silver tsunami the aging and then someone told me that was too negative so i call it the silver surge the aging of the population we need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen medicaid in this state the state of ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed those are the issues that i hear about when im in toledo ,6
Marc Lacey, let me bring you in here vice president for your response are senators warren and sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans,6
Joe Biden, first of all the plan were hearing discussed is the biden plan the one i put forward build on obamacare at public option we can go into that i can talk about that if youd like but heres the deal on the single most important thing facing the american public i think its awfully important to be straightforward with them the plan is going to cost at least 30 trillion over 10 years that is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how were going to pay for it the study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs but for people making between 50 and 75000 year their taxes are going to go up about 5000 because the fact is theyll pay more in new taxes 74 plus or 5 plus a 4 income tax if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100000 bucks a year their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand that is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan we have a plan put forward that will work,6
Marc Lacey, senator sanders do you want to respond to that,6
Bernie Sanders, i get a little bit tired i must say of people defending a system which is dysfunctional which is cruel 87 million uninsured 30000 people dying every single year 500000 people going bankrupt for what reason they came down with cancer i will tell you what the issue is here the issue is whether the democratic party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry which made 100 billion in profit whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price fixing pharmaceutical industry which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and if we dont have the guts to do that if all we could do is take their money we should be ashamed of ourselves,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator senator harris your response,6
Kamala Harris, this is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on womens access to reproductive healthcare which its under full on attack in america today and its outrageous there are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare and it is not an exaggeration to say women will die poor women women of color will die because these republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with america are telling women what to do with our bodies women are the majority of the population in this country people need to keep their hands off of womens bodies and let women make the,6
Kamala Harris,  country people need to keep their hands off of womens bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator thank you senator,6
Kamala Harris, lets talk about that that is a significant healthcare issue in america today,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Erin Burnett, i want to turn now to jobs according to a recent study about a quarter of american jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit senator sanders you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation but tens of millions of americans could end up losing their jobs are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those americans,6
Bernie Sanders, damn right we will and ill tell you why if you look up what goes on in america today we have an infrastructure which is collapsing we can put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads our bridges our water systems our wastewater plants airports et cetera furthermore and i hope we will discuss it at length tonight this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change and the green new deal that i have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy we need workers to do childcare we need workers great teachers to come in to school systems which dont have the teachers that we need right now we need more doctors we need more dentists we need more carpenters we need more sheet metal metalworkers when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuitionfree and canceling student debt were going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs,6
Erin Burnett, senator sanders thank you mr yang your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income why is giving people 1000 a month better than sanders plan guaranteeing them a job,6
Andrew Yang, i am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice what are the jobs who manages you what if you dont like your job what if youre not good at your job the fact is most americans do not want to work for the federal government and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most americans would embrace,6
Andrew Yang, also senator sanders description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife whos at home with our two boys one of whom is autistic we have a freedom dividend of 1000 a month it actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities it helps all americans transition because the fact is and you know this in ohio if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants when we put the money into our hands we can build a trickleup economy from our people our families and our communities up it will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do this is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party,6
Erin Burnett, senator booker a federal jobs guarantee or 1000 a month are those the best solutions there please respond,6
Senator Booker, well first of all im happy to get in finally i just want to say as a great new jerseyan yogi berra said i am having deja vu all over again im having days of google all over again first of all because i saw this play in 2016s election we are literally using donald trumps lies and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman that was so offensive he should not have to defend ourselves the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was donald trump seeing that were distracting from his malfeasance and the selling out of his office,6
Senator Booker, im having deja vu all over again because we have another healthcare debate and were not talking about the clear and existential threat in america that were in a state that has had two planned parenthoods close we are seeing all over this country womens reproductive rights under attack god bless kamala but you know what women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight men,6
Erin Burnett, thank you,6
Senator Booker, it is not just because women are our daughters,6
Erin Burnett, senator,6
Senator Booker, and our friends and our wives its because women are people and people deserve to control their own body,6
Erin Burnett, senator thank you we are going to get to that issue later on tonight senator warren you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is a good story except its not really true should workers here in ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation,6
Senator Warren, the data show that weve had a lot of problems with losing jobs but the principle reason has been bad trade policy the principle reason has been a bunch of corporations giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to america they have no loyalty to american workers they have no loyalty to american consumers they have no loyalty to american communities they are loyal only to their own bottom line,6
Senator Warren, i have a plan to fix that and its accountable capitalism it says you want to have one of the giant corporations in america then by golly 40 of your board of directors should be elected by your employees thatll make a difference when a corporation decides gee we can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico when there are people on the board in the board room saying no do you know what that does to our company do you know what that does to our community what it does to our workers we also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate we need to restructure strength in this economy and thats where it starts,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator secretary castro whats your response to senator warrens claim that automation is a good story except its not really true,6
Julian Castro, well i think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue right yeah i believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation im even willing to pilot something like ubi and to see how that would work but i think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country as i mentioned earlier here in ohio in the latest job data ohio is losing jobs under donald trump he has broken his promises to ohio and the industrial midwest i would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work i would invest in a green new deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy,6
Julian Castro, i was in newton iowa a few weeks ago and i visited a place called tpi newton iowa had a maytag washing machine manufacturing facility and then it closed down tpi manufacturers wind turbines theyre putting hundreds of people to work at decent paying jobs and creating a better future for those families on top of that let me just say this we need to support working families we need to invest in things like universal childcare,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr secretary,6
Julian Castro, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 of their income for it,6
Andrew Yang, senator warren i just need to address this senator warren ive been talking,6
Erin Burnett, go ahead mr yang,6
Andrew Yang, to americans around the country about automation and theyre smart they see whats happening around them their main street stores are closing they see a selfserve kiosk in every mcdonalds every grocery store every cvs driving a truck as the most common job in 29 states including this one three and a half million truck drivers in this country and my friends in california are piloting self driving trucks what does that going to mean for the three and a half million truckers or the seven million americans who work in truck stops motels and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that americans see around us every single day,6
Erin Burnett, senator warren respond please,6
Pete Buttigieg, this is exactly what i said,6
Senator Warren, i understand that what were all looking for is how we strengthen americas middle class actually i think the thing closest to the universal basic income is social security its one of the reasons that i put forward a plan to extend the solvency of social security by decades and add 200 to the payment of every person who receives social security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now that 200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more it also has a provision for your wife for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their social security,6
Erin Burnett, thank you,6
Senator Warren, so after a lifetime of hard work people are entitled to retire with dignity,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator warren,6
Senator Warren, i see this is an important question but i want to understand the data on this,6
Erin Burnett, senator thank you very much,6
Senator Warren, i want to make sure were responding to make this work,6
Erin Burnett, your time is up,6
Andrew Yang, i have the data,6
Erin Burnett, i want to give congresswoman gabbard a chance to respond,6
Tulsi Gabbard, thank you you know really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded as people look to this automation revolution they look to uncertainty they dont know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives i agree with my friend andrew yang i think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see this has to do with bad trade deals that weve seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the american people i do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that the value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as americans whatever we choose to do with our lives and we cant forget that,6
Erin Burnett, thank you very much,6
Marc Lacey, one of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry general motors used to be the largest employer in ohio now its 72nd today thousands of gm workers here in ohio and across the country are on strike all of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers senator booker one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from mexico as president how would you convince gm to return production to the united states,6
Senator Booker, well first of all the one point i wanted to make about the ubi conversation and i hope that my friend andrew yang will come out for this doing more for workers than ubi would actually be just raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour it would put more money in peoples pockets than giving them 1000 a month we have to start putting the dignity back in work number one you start having trade deals not like this thing that the president is trying to push through congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesnt put workers at the center of every trade deal we must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed,6
Senator Booker, but its more than that i stood with these workers because were seeing this trend all over our country i stood with unions because right now unions in america are under attack as union membership has gone down we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country so the other thing that ill do as president of the united states is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers conditions and make sure that every american has a living wage in this country,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator congressman orourke same question for you how would you convince gm to bring production back to the united states from mexico,6
Beto O’Rourke, ive met with these members of the uaw who are striking outside of facilities in cincinnati in lordstown ohio which has just been devastated decimated by gm and their malfeasance paying effectively zero in taxes last year the people of ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there what they want is a shot they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country which they are not receiving today,6
Beto O’Rourke, part of the way to do that is through our trade deals making sure that if we trade with mexico mexican workers are allowed to join unions which they are effectively unable to do today not only is that bad for the mexican worker it puts the american worker at a competitive disadvantage if we compliment that with investment in worldclass pre k through 12 public education get behind our worldclass public school educators if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years we will make sure that every single american has a shot they dont want a handout they dont want a job guarantee they just want a shot and as president i will give them that shot,6
Marc Lacey, thank you congressman,6
Erin Burnett, income inequality is growing in the united states at an alarming rate the top 1 now own more of this nations wealth than the bottom 90 combined senator sanders when you introduced your wealth tax which would tax the assets of the wealthiest americans you said quoting you senator  billionaires should not exist is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence,6
Bernie Sanders, when you have a half a million americans sleeping out on the street today when you have 87 million people uninsured or underinsured when youve got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of american society that is a moral and economic outrage the truth is we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years if you are asking me do i think we should demand that the wealthy start paying the wealthiest top onetenth of 1 start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us yes thats exactly what i believe,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator mr steyer you are the lone billionaire on this stage,6
Tom Steyer, ha,6
Erin Burnett, whats your plan for closing the income gap,6
Tom Steyer, well first of all let me say this senator sanders is right there have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government and those 40 years have meant a 40year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor the results are as shameful as senator sanders says both in terms of assets and in terms of income its absolutely wrong its absolutely undemocratic and unfair i was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax i would undo every republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations,6
Tom Steyer, but theres something else going on here that is absolutely shameful and thats the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings as a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor people havent had a raise 90 of americans have not had a raise for 40 years if you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation you get 11 bucks its seven and a quarter if you included the productivity gains of american workers itd be over 20 bucks theres something wrong here and that is that the corporations have bought our government our government has failed thats why im running for president because were not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants healthcare education green new deal or a living wage,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr steyer,6
Tom Steyer, unless we break the power of these corporations,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr steyer vice president biden you have warned against demonizing rich people do you believe that senator sanders and senator warrens wealth tax plans do that,6
Joe Biden, no look demonizing wealthy people what i talked about is how you get things done the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now we have to start rewarding work not just wealth i would eliminate the capital gains tax that i would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 395 i would double it because guess what why in gods name should someone whos clipping coupons in the stock market make in fact pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is like i said a school teacher and a firefighter its ridiculous and they pay a lower tax,6
Joe Biden, secondly the idea that we in fact engage in this notion that there are theres 1 trillion 640 billion in tax loopholes you cant justify a minimum 600 billion of that we can eliminate it all i could go into detail had i the time thirdly what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the american people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy were going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not this is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given the fact is everybodys right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs it is the fact is also corporate greed if theyre going back theyre not investing in their employees theyre reinvesting and buying back their stock,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr vice president thank you mr vice president,6
Joe Biden, see im doing the same thing,6
Erin Burnett, senator warren your response,6
Senator Warren, i think this is about our values as a country show me your budget show me your tax plans and well know what your values are right now in america the top one tenth of 1 have so much wealth understand this that if we put a twocent tax on their 50000001st dollar and on every dollar after that we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five universal prek for every child raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america provide for universal tuitionfree college put 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator warren,6
Senator Warren, and cancel no let me finish please and cancel student loan debt for 95 of the people who have it my question is not why do bernie and i support a wealth tax its why does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of americans,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator warren,6
Joe Biden, no one is supporting billionaires,6
Erin Burnett, mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg your response,6
Pete Buttigieg, im all for a wealth tax im all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers let me tell you though how this looks from the industrial midwest where i live washington politicians congressmen and senators saying all the right things offering the most elegant policy prescriptions and nothing changes i didnt even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that i would see out the windows of my dads chevy cavalier when he drove me to school i didnt know that wasnt every city until i went away to college now i drive my own chevy its a chevy cruze used to be built right in lordstown which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers but why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place its because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything and while hes unquestionably made it dramatically worse this is time to realize that were paying attention to the wrong things were paying attention,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mayor thank you mayor buttigieg,6
Pete Buttigieg, to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing versus what its actually going to take to get something done,6
Erin Burnett, senator klobuchar senator klobuchar,6
Amy Klobuchar, i want to give a reality,6
Erin Burnett, will a wealth tax work,6
Amy Klobuchar, it could work i am open to it but i want to give a reality check here to elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires we just have different approaches your idea is not the only idea when i look at this i think about donald trump the guy that after that tax bill passed went to maralago got together with his cronies and said guess what you guys all got a lot richer that was the one time in his presidency he told the truth we have different ways i would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich including what he did with the corporate tax rate including what he did on international taxation you add it all up you got a lot of money that one helps pay for that childcare protects that dignity of work makes sure we have decent retirement and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools,6
Erin Burnett, thank you,6
Amy Klobuchar, it is not one idea that rules here,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator klobuchar senator warren please respond,6
Senator Warren, understand taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way tax and wealth does that the rich are not like you and me the really really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing we need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation look i understand that this is hard but i think as democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard not when we dream small and quit before we get started,6
Amy Klobuchar, oh i would like to respond to that,6
Erin Burnett, senator klobuchar respond please,6
Amy Klobuchar, i think simply because you have different ideas doesnt mean youre fighting for regular people i wouldnt even be up on this stage if it wasnt for unions and the dignity of work if my grandpa didnt have unions protecting him in those mines he wouldnt have survived if my mom didnt have unions as a teacher she wouldnt have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating donald trump and taking this on we are in ohio we can win ohio and the presidency but only if we unite if we unite around ideals and dont go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator senator harris you want to give working families a tax credit of up to 6000 a year to help close the income gap,6
Kamala Harris, right,6
Erin Burnett, is that a better solution than a wealth tax,6
Kamala Harris, well heres how i think about it when i was growing up my mother raised my sister and me we would often come home from school before she came home from work shed come home shed cook dinner and at some point wed go to bed and shed sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work when i think about where we are right now in 2020 i do believe justices on the ballot its on the ballot in terms of impeachment its on the ballot in terms of economic justice health justice and so many other issues when i think about this issue im thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting his kitchen table after everyones gone to sleep and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how hes going to make it work hes probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month hes going to have to start driving an uber,6
Kamala Harris, what does that mean that means that with those two jobs hes going to miss his kids soccer games thats the reality for americans today which is why yes when i get elected and and pass this bill which will give the american family who makes less than 100000 a year a tax credit of up to 6000 a year that they can take home at up to 500 a month thats going to make a real difference in that mans life dont tell him thats not a big deal,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator,6
Kamala Harris, when hes trying to get through the end of the month,6
Erin Burnett, mr yang your response would you oppose a wealth tax,6
Andrew Yang, senator warren is 100 right that were in the midst of the most extreme winnertakeall economy in history and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle the problem is that its been tried in germany france denmark sweden and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that theyd projected if we cant learn from the failed experiences of other countries what can we learn from we should not be looking to other countries mistakes instead we should look at what germany france denmark and sweden still have which is a valueadded tax if we give the american people a tiny slice of every amazon sale every google search every robot truck mile every facebook ad we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it,6
Erin Burnett, thank you thank you congressman orourke do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality your response,6
Beto O’Rourke, i think its part of the solution but i think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes i think that senator warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions i think of a woman that i met in las vegas nevada shes working four jobs raising her child with disabilities any american with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already some of those jobs working for some of these corporations,6
Beto O’Rourke, she wants to know how we are going to help her how were going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage senator warren said show me your budget show me your tax plan and youll show me your values she has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person i met would see a tax increase under my administration if you make less than 250000 a year as a family you will not see a tax increase that family needs to know that,6
Erin Burnett, thank you congressman,6
Tom Steyer, erin let me say this is a,6
Erin Burnett, i want to give senator warren a chance to respond,6
Senator Warren, im really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks im punitive look i dont have a beef with billionaires my problem is you made a fortune in america you had a great idea you got out there and worked for it good for you but you built that fortune in america i guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate you built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for you built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for all im saying is you make it to the top the top onetenth of 1 then pitch in two cents so every other kid in america has a chance to make it,6
Erin Burnett, senator thank you secretary castro your response,6
Beto O’Rourke, theres no argument there i just want to make sure that were lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit,6
Senator Warren, but that is,6
Beto O’Rourke, or child tax credit which we will do in my administration,6
Erin Burnett, go ahead go ahead senator,6
Senator Warren, that is the point this is universal childcare for every baby in this country early educational opportunities for every child universal prek no matter where you live for every threeyearold and fouryearold raising the wages,6
Beto O’Rourke, but in addition to that will they see a tax increase,6
Senator Warren, no raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country this is about universal college about investment in our hbcus about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator thank you senator,6
Senator Warren, that is crushing 43 million american,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator secretary castro,6
Beto O’Rourke, on this much we agree i just want to know if working families are going to get a tax increase,6
Erin Burnett, i want to get secretary castro in here please congressman go ahead secretary,6
Julian Castro, thanks a lot erin you see that everybody has their own plans let me just say that the way that i view this is born out of my own experience i grew up like i bet a lot of folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on tv i grew up with my twin brother walking in a single parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom my grandmother and we knew what it was like a to wonder whether were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off and when i was a kid to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter and thats whats happening to a lot of families these days,6
Julian Castro, i was in las vegas a few months ago and i visited people who are homeless who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the las vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations we can do better than that i believe that a wealth inequality tax as ive proposed is part of the answer but also ive proposed an inheritance tax raising the top marginal tax rate,6
Erin Burnett, thank you secretary,6
Bernie Sanders, erin erin erin,6
Julian Castro, and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing,6
Erin Burnett, senator booker please respond,6
Senator Booker, well first of all i just want to respond by you know weve got one shot to make donald trump a oneterm president how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters ive had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable i have seen this script before it didnt work in 2016 and it will be disaster for us in 2020,6
Senator Booker, i have a different plan than elizabeth warren i have a different plan than many people on this stage it involves again fair taxes for the richest we have a lot of work to do there but weve had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in america of child poverty we have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure a fair taxes are paid by people on the top but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world my plan will focus on that and these are some of the issues we should be talking about not defining ourselves just by what were against but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for,6
Amy Klobuchar, amen,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator booker,6
A. Cooper, weve got to take a quick break weve got to take a quick break right now the cnnnew york times debate live from otterbein university in ohio will be right back after this,6
Anderson Cooper, welcome back to the cnnnew york times democratic presidential debate live from otterbein university in westerville ohio i want to turn now to foreign policy president trump ordered the withdrawal of all american forces from northern syria abandoning americas longtime kurdish allies as a result turkey has now invaded syria isis detainees have escaped and the kurds have announced a new deal with the government in damascus a victory for syrian dictator bashar alassad and russia and iran,6
Anderson Cooper, vice president biden we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern syria in this way but that is already in process so would you send american troops back into northern syria to prevent an isis resurgence and protect our kurdish allies,6
Joe Biden, i would not have withdrawn the troops and i would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in iraq which are in retreat now being fired on by assads people and the president of the united states saying if those isis folks escape from the prisons theyre in theyll only go to europe it wont affect us it has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history excuse me in terms of foreign policy and the fact of the matter is ive never seen a time and i spent thousands of hours in the situation room ive spent many hours on the ground in those very places in syria and in iraq and guess what our commanders across the board former and present are ashamed of whats happening here,6
Joe Biden, what i would do is i would be making it real clear to assad that in fact hes going to have a problem because turkey is the real problem here and i would be having a real lockdown conversation with erdogan and letting him know that hes going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now pay that price,6
Anderson Cooper, just to clarify mr vice president would you want american troops back in northern syria,6
Joe Biden, i would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover those thousand troops that are having to withdraw under fire make it clear that theyre not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done protecting those kurds they lost their lives this is shameful shameful what this man has done,6
Anderson Cooper, congresswoman gabbard last week you said that american troops should get out of syria now you dont agree with how the president handled the withdrawal what would you have done differently how would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed were seeing now,6
Tulsi Gabbard, oh first of all weve got to understand the reality of the situation there which is that the slaughter of the kurds being done by turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that weve been waging in syria donald trump has the blood of the kurds on his hand but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in syria that started in 2011 along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war,6
Tulsi Gabbard, not only that but new york times and cnn have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war just two days ago the new york times put out an article saying that im a russian asset and an assad apologist and all these different smears this morning a cnn commentator said on national television that im an asset of russia completely despicable,6
Tulsi Gabbard, as president i will end these regime change wars by doing two things ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege the likes of which we are seeing saudi arabia wage against yemen that have caused tens and thousands of syrian civilians to die and to starve and i would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like alqaeda in syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war,6
Tulsi Gabbard, id like to ask senator warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in syria finally,6
Senator Warren, so look i think that we ought to get out of the middle east i dont think we should have troops in the middle east but we have to do it the right way the smart way what this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesnt understand he has cut and run on our allies and he has enriched himself at the expense of the united states of america in syria he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis he has helped isis get another foothold a new lease on life i sit on the armed services committee i talk with our military leaders about this,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Warren, i was in iraq and went through the neighborhoods that isis destroyed we need to get out,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Senator Warren,  but we need to do this through a negotiated solution,6
Anderson Cooper, yeah thank you senator,6
Senator Warren, there is no military solution,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg,6
Senator Warren,  in this region,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg like many of your fellow candidates on the stage youve been calling for an end to endless wars whats your response on syria,6
Pete Buttigieg, well respectfully congresswoman i think that is dead wrong the slaughter going on in syria is not a consequence of american presence its a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of american allies and american values look i didnt think we shouldve gone to iraq in the first place i think we need to get out of afghanistan but its also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of syria and what were seeing now which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of isis,6
Pete Buttigieg, meanwhile soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed ashamed of what their country has done we saw the spectacle the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking what the hell happened to american leadership and when i was deployed i knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word and our allies knew it and our enemies lose that,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Pete Buttigieg, you take that away you are taking away what makes america america,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Pete Buttigieg, it makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place,6
Anderson Cooper, congresswoman gabbard your response,6
Tulsi Gabbard, yeah absolutely so really what youre saying mayor pete is that you would continue to support having us troops in syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee syria that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security you would continue this policy of the us actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in syria like alqaeda hts alnusra and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war thats really what youre saying,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg,6
Pete Buttigieg, no you can embrace or you can put an end to endless war without embracing donald trumps policy as youre doing,6
Tulsi Gabbard, will you end the regime change war is the question,6
Pete Buttigieg, what we are doing,6
Tulsi Gabbard, what is an endless war if its not yet another regime change war,6
Anderson Cooper, allow him to respond please allow him to respond,6
Pete Buttigieg, what we are doing or what we were doing in syria was keeping our word part of what makes it possible for the united states to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too when i was deployed not just the afghan national army forces but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with us forces i would have a hard time today looking an afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there and it is undermining the honor of our soldiers you take away,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Pete Buttigieg,  the honor of our soldiers you might as well go after their body armor next this president has betrayed american values,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Pete Buttigieg,  our credibility is in tatter i will restore us credibility before it is finally too late,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders is his turkey still a us ally should they remain in nato,6
Bernie Sanders, im sorry say that again,6
Anderson Cooper, is turkey is still a us ally should they remain in nato,6
Bernie Sanders, no turkey is not a us ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter the crisis here as i think joe said and pete said is when you begin to betray people  and in terms of the kurds 11000 of them died fighting isis 20000 were wounded and the united states said we are with you were standing with you and then suddenly one day after a phone call with erdogan announced by tweet trump reverses that policy now you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the united states in other words what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Pete Buttigieg, but this is really important because what this president has done shows that american leadership shapes the behavior of our allies or sometimes allies too remember the problem right now is not just with our competitors in for example a place like china the people of hong kong rise up for democracy and dont get a peep of support from the president its not just the behavior of adversaries like russia but our onetime allies like saudi arabia which the cia just concluded was responsible as we all knew for murdering and dismembering an american resident and journalist and turkey which was an american ally thats the point we had leverage but when we abandoned the international stage when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation the consequence is,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Pete Buttigieg,  the disappearance of us leadership from the world stage and that makes this entire world a more dangerous place,6
Anderson Cooper, senator klobuchar should turkey remain in nato your response,6
Amy Klobuchar, we need to work with our allies to work with turkey and bring them out this is an outrageous thing that happened here and i think we need to talk about this a not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with turkey but the fact that our president blew it and now hes too proud to say it and what do we do now we continue that humanitarian aid but then we work with our allies to say come back turkey and stop this because what mayor pete has just said is true think about our other allies israel how do they feel right now donald trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the mideast think about our allies in europe when he pulls out of the iranian agreement and leaves them holding the bag and gives the power to china and russia,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Amy Klobuchar, think about the nuclear agreement with russia that he precipitously pulled out of this is part of a pattern its not an isolated incident,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator senator harris given that the us abandoned our kurdish allies what would you do as president to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted,6
Kamala Harris, thats a great question anderson because the commander in chief of the united states of america has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland i serve on the senate intelligence committee i have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security and hotspots around the world,6
Kamala Harris, what has happened in syria is yet again donald trump selling folks out and in this case he sold out the kurds who yes fought with us and thousands died in our fight against isis and lets be clear what donald trump has done because of that phone call with erdogan is basically giving 10000 isis fighters a get out of jail free card and you know who the winner is in this there are four russia iran assad and isis this is a crisis of donald trumps making and it is on a long list of crises of donald trumps making and thats why dude got to go and when i am commander in chief we will stop this madness,6
Anderson Cooper, secretary castro your response,6
Julian Castro, well i mean you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again the first thing is weve got to boot donald trump out of the oval office so that people will trust us again you know i also want people to think the folks this week that saw those images of isis prisoners running free to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting isis prisoners run free he has made a tremendous mistake a total disaster there in syria,6
Julian Castro, and just to connect the dots for a second if youre kim jong un for instance why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up an iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago which was the strongest agreement to contain irans nuclear weapons program and now hes abandoned the very people that we gave our word to,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Julian Castro, i would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure syria,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Julian Castro,  to stop the aggression and i support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mr secretary,6
Marc Lacey, senator booker the american intelligence community says that russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as were seeing right now in northern syria what specifically would you do as president to check vladimir putins power on the world stage,6
Senator Booker, so first of all understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire we literally have great generals like mattis who said on the world stage the united states of america there can be no better friend than the united states of america and no greater enemy than the united states of america this president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with russia,6
Senator Booker, and so clearly to your question number one we cannot allow the russians to continue to grow and influence by abandoning the world stage we cannot allow russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the ukraine and latvia and lithuania but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable russia and putin understand strength and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness,6
Senator Booker, he makes promises to the american people that hes going to protect this nation well instead of doing something to defeat isis hes now given them a foothold again this is an american president that even right now is lying to the american public and saying hes bringing our troops home at the same time hes increasing true presence with the saudis while theyre involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in yemen this president is making us less safe he is partnering more with putin than he is with merkel and macron as president of the united states i will stop this and restore american integrity abroad,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator vice president,6
Joe Biden, i think i may be doesnt make me any better or worse but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with putin as well as with erdogan and erdogan understands that  you talk about should he stay in or out of nato he understands that hes out of nato hes in real trouble but the fact of the matter is we have been one willing in this administration because we have an erratic crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection think whats happened the fact of the matter is you have russia influencing and trying to break up nato what does the president do he says i believe vladimir putin i dont believe our intelligence community,6
Bernie Sanders, are you suggesting im vladimir putin,6
Joe Biden, no no im not no no im not im not im not,6
Bernie Sanders, i know,6
Joe Biden, im not but here look but heres the deal think what that did he turns around and he questions whether or not hell keep the sacred commitment of article 5 for the nato members if he is reelected i promise you there will be no nato our security will be vastly underrated under  we will be in real trouble,6
Joe Biden, and with regard to regime change in syria that has not been the policy wed change the regime it has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the iraqi border and lastly and i apologize for going up but lastly what is happening in iraq is going to i mean excuse me in afghanistan as well as all the way over to syria we have isis its going to come here they are going to in fact damage the united states of america thats why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to assad and to the russians,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr vice president congressman orourke senate democrats put out a report last year on russias hostile actions around the world they suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the us knows about putins corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts would you take either of those actions even in the face of possible retaliation,6
Beto O’Rourke, yes we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold russia accountable for invading the worlds greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to donald trump functionally with impunity so far so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak still at the invitation of this president so if there are not consequences we will continue to see this problem going forward,6
Beto O’Rourke, but in addition  to answer the previous question that you asked how do we stand up to russia on the global stage we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships that is what makes america stronger there isnt enough money in this country there arent enough service members as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world,6
Beto O’Rourke, and the kurds are case in point in fact because we turned our backs on them those kurds who fought for us in syria helped to defeat isis not just for themselves but for the united states of america it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there,6
Beto O’Rourke, and then lastly as general mattis who was invoked earlier has said we have two powers one of intimidation and one of inspiration we need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our state department and peacefully and nonviolently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of 18 and 19 and 20 year olds anymore but making sure that our diplomats are invested in have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world,6
Marc Lacey, thank you congressman mr steyer would you publicly reveal what the us knows about putins corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts please respond,6
Tom Steyer, absolutely as far as im concerned mr trumps america first program which involves having no plans having no process and having no partners is proved to be a disaster in syria its proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to russias attacking our democracy and more than that when we look at the problems around the world the idea that the united states is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense,6
Tom Steyer, lets go to the most important international problem that were facing which no one has brought up which is climate we cant solve the climate crisis in the united states by ourselves its an international crisis ive been working on it for 10 years taking on the corporations but we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world so if you look at what mr trump is doing of course hes been bought by the oil and gas companies but any problem that were going to do but specifically climate were going to have to lead the world morally were going to have to lead it technologically financially and commercially this is the proof that this kind of america first go it alone trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea ive ever heard and i would change it on day one in every single light,6
Marc Lacey, mr yang your response to putin and russia,6
Andrew Yang, of course we have to look at the chain of events how did we get here the fact is we were falling apart at home so we voted in donald trump and hes now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy we have to let russia know look we get it weve tampered with other elections youve tampered with our elections and now it has to stop and if it does not stop we will take this as an act of hostility against the american people i believe most americans would support me on this,6
Andrew Yang, but russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats artificial intelligence cybersecurity climate change loose nuclear material military drones and nonstate actors these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology we all know we are decades behind the curve on technology we saw when mark zuckerberg testified at congress the nature of the questioning as commander in chief i will help pull us forward,6
Marc Lacey, thank you,6
Amy Klobuchar, marc i want to respond,6
Andrew Yang,  and thats going to be a huge responsibility of the next president,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr yang,6
Amy Klobuchar, i want to respond to mr yang i dont see a moral equivalency between our country and russia vladimir putin is someone who has shot down planes over ukraine who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from russia invading our election this wasnt meddling thats what i do when i call my daughter on a saturday night and ask her what shes doing sorry,6
Joe Biden, he has no soul,6
Amy Klobuchar, this was much more serious than that this was actually invading our election so to protect ourselves in 2020 what we need one backup paper ballots in every single state that is the bill that i need and we need to stop mitch mcconnell from stopping that from happening and then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads including ones last time in rubles without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them thats the honest ads act thats a bipartisan bill that i lead and we cant wait to become,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Amy Klobuchar,  president to get that done we need to get it done now,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you we want to turn back to domestic issues in the epidemic of gun violence in this country were less than 100 miles from dayton ohio where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an ar15 style weapon with a high capacity magazine congressman orourke in the last debate you said hell yes were going to take your ar15 your ak47 but when you were asked how youd enforce a mandatory buyback you said police wouldnt be going door to door so how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons you dont even know who has those weapons,6
Beto O’Rourke, look were going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow americans i think almost everyone on this stage agrees that its not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of ar15s and ak47s those are weapons of war that they were designed to kill people effectively efficiently on a battlefield you mentioned the massacre in dayton nine people killed in under 40 seconds in el paso texas 22 were killed in under three minutes and the list goes on throughout the country,6
Beto O’Rourke, so if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million ar15s and ak47s out there theyre also too dangerous to own every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror just ask hispanics in texas univision surveyed them more than 80 feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in el paso that was targeted at mexican americans and immigrants inspired in part by this presidents racism and hatred that hes directed at communities like mine in el paso,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman,6
Beto O’Rourke, so i expect my fellow americans to follow the law the same way that we enforce any provision any law that we have right now we dont go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law i expect republicans democrats gun owners non gun owners alike,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman let me follow up,6
Beto O’Rourke,  to respect and follow the law,6
Anderson Cooper, just to follow up your expectations aside your website says you will find people who dont give up their weapons that doesnt take those weapons off the streets so to be clear exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you dont know where they are,6
Beto O’Rourke, if someone does not turn in an ar15 or an ak47 one of these weapons of war or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate as we saw when we were at kent state recently then that weapon will be taken from them if they persist there will be other consequences from law enforcement but the expectation is that americans will follow the law i believe in this country i believe in my fellow americans i believe that they will do the right thing,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor buttigieg just yesterday you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation and said that congressman orourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant your response on guns,6
Pete Buttigieg, well congressman you just made it clear that you dont know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets if you can develop the plan further i think we can have a debate about it but we cant wait people are dying in the streets right now we cant wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through we cant wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high capacity magazines so we dont wind up with millions more of these things on the street we cant wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country we cannot wait for purity tests we have to just get something done,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman orourke your response,6
Beto O’Rourke, this is not a purity test this is a country that loses 40000 of fellow americans every year to gun violence this is a crisis and weve got to do something about it and those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that im describing i want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war but to use the analogy of healthcare it would be as though we said look were for primary care but lets not talk about mental healthcare because thats a bridge too far people need that primary care now so lets save that for another day no lets decide what we are going to believe in what we are going to achieve and then lets bring this country together in order to do that listening to my fellow americans to those moms who demand action to those students who march for our lives who in fact came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congressman,6
Beto O’Rourke,  that calls for mandatory buybacks lets follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups lets do whats right,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg your response,6
Beto O’Rourke,  while we have time to do whats right,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg,6
Pete Buttigieg, the problem isnt the polls the problem is the policy and i dont need lessons from you on courage political or personal everyone on this stage is determined to get something done everyone on this stage recognizes or at least i thought we did that the problem is not other democrats who dont agree with your particular idea of how to handle this the problem is the national rifle association and their enablers in congress and we should be united in taking the fight to them,6
Beto O’Rourke, thats a mischaracterization anderson ive got answered this never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue but when you mayor buttigieg described this policy as a shiny object i dont care what that meant to me or my candidacy but to those who have survived gun violence those whove lost a loved one to an ar15 an ak47 march for our lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the nra and conventional politics and polltested politicians that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an ar15 and an ak47 we must buy them back,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman thank,6
Pete Buttigieg, what we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution im glad you offered up,6
Anderson Cooper, all right,6
Pete Buttigieg,  that analogy to healthcare because this is really important we are at the cusp of building a new american majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Pete Buttigieg,  adult life no this is really important okay on guns we are this close to an assault weapons ban that would be huge,6
Pete Buttigieg,  guns we are this close to an assault weapons ban that would be huge and were going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether its hell yes were going to take your guns we have an opportunity to deliver,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you ,6
Pete Buttigieg,  healthcare to everybody and someone on this stage was saying it doesnt count,6
Beto O’Rourke, ,6
Anderson Cooper, senator buttigieg i want to give other candidates a chance senator booker whats your response to mayor buttigieg,6
Senator Booker, look i again worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown theres a young man in my neighborhood  i watched him grow up i lived in some high rise projects with him  named shahad and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle im living with a sense of urgency on this problem because when i go home to my community like millions of americans we live in communities where these weapons where these gunshots are real every single day and i know where the american public is,6
Senator Booker, this is not about leadership this is why when i talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us im not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues we all have courage but its frustrating that when the american people 77 of americans agree on licensing we dont need leadership right now we just need folks who are going to stand up and follow where the people already are because there are millions of americans where this is a daily nightmare where were surrendering our freedoms,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Senator Booker,  to fear in this country this is the first time in american history this fall where we have sent our children to school the strongest nation on the planet earth and said to them we cant protect you,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Booker,  so in school were going to teach you how to hide there are more duckandcover drills and shelterinplace drills in america now than fire drills,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Booker, if im president of the united states i will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure we end the scourge of mass violence,6
Anderson Cooper, senator klobuchar senator warren supports a voluntary  excuse me senator klobuchar you support a voluntary buyback if im correct right,6
Amy Klobuchar, correct,6
Anderson Cooper, what is wrong with a mandatory buyback your response,6
Amy Klobuchar, i just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this im looking at the mayor of dayton i met one of those survivors from that shooting 30 seconds nine people killed the public is with us on this in a big way the majority of trump voters want to see universal background checks right now the majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation there are three bills right now on mitch mcconnells desk the background check bill my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers dont get guns the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun thats what we should be focusing on and i just dont want to screw this up when im president i do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and i do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in dayton ohio will never happen again but lets not mess this up with this fight,6
Anderson Cooper, senator warren you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault style weapons as well why not a mandatory one,6
Senator Warren, look i want to get what works done i want to use the method we used for example with machine guns we registered them we put in a huge penalty if you didnt register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in and it got machine guns out of the hands of people but the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is as youve rightly identified its not just about mass shootings its what happens in neighborhoods all across this country,6
Senator Warren, it is about suicide it is about domestic violence this is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then were done we have to reduce gun violence overall and the question we have to ask is why hasnt it happened you say were so close we have been so close i stood in the united states senate in 2013 when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Warren,  and it didnt pass because of the filibuster,6
Anderson Cooper, senator,6
Senator Warren, weve got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibusters,6
Anderson Cooper, senator harris,6
Senator Warren,  or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens,6
Anderson Cooper, senator harris you disagree with senator warren you think the buyback should be mandatory please respond,6
Kamala Harris, five million assault weapons are on the streets of america today during the course of this debate eight people will die from gun violence the leading cause of death of young black men in america is gun violence more than the top other six reasons totaled this is a serious matter i have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than i care to tell you i have looked at more autopsy photographs than i care to tell you i have attended more police officer funerals than i care to tell you,6
Kamala Harris, im done and we need action and congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage when im elected ill give them 100 days to pull their act together put a bill on my desk for signature and if they dont i will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act,6
Anderson Cooper, vice president biden your response,6
Joe Biden, im the only one on this stage who has taken on the nra and beat them and beat them twice we were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred the way to deal with those guns and those ar15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the national firearms act as it related to machine guns you must register that weapon you must register it when you register it the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially im the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it ive done this i know how to get it done if you really want to get it done go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued that will ,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mr vice president secretary castro the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from hand guns not assault style weapons whats your plan to prevent those deaths,6
Julian Castro, thank you very much for the question you know i grew up in neighborhoods where it wasnt uncommon to hear gunshots at night and i can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when i was a freshman in high school across the street from my school my public school because folks were shooting at each other you know in the neighborhoods  let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory there are two problems i have with mandatory buybacks number one folks cant define it and if youre not going to door door to door then its not really mandatory,6
Julian Castro, but also in the places that i grew up in we werent exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door and yall saw a couple of days ago what happened to tatiana jefferson in fort worth cops showed up at 200 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew he didnt even announce himself and within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her home window she was in her own home and so i am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that,6
Anderson Cooper, senator castro thank you,6
Marc Lacey, turning to another key issue here in ohio and around the country the opioid epidemic senator klobuchar cnn reached out to ohio democratic voters for their most pressing questions bri a teacher in proctorville asks  in rural ohio the opioid epidemic has effected our communities and schools i have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin teachers are on the front lines daily witnessing these tragedies how will you tackle this problem in general but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult,6
Amy Klobuchar, well i want to thank her for this question this is something that should never have happened to begin with i remember when i was a prosecutor these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door and its gotten worse and worse and we now know why as the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits probably one of the most horrible things that i saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said keep pumping them out theyre eating them like doritos,6
Amy Klobuchar, so my first answer to that question and which is included in my plan is that the people that should pay for this that should pay for the treatment are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place and that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids thats the first way you can with a 2 cents per milligram tax bring in the money plus with the federal master settlement to help in rural areas where theyre so isolated and also in urban areas where its by the way not just opioids there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues,6
Amy Klobuchar, this is personal for me my dad he struggled with alcoholism his whole life and by his third dwi they said to him the prosecutor youve got to face jail or youve got to go to treatment he picked treatment and he was pursued by grace he has been sober ever since and now hes 91 and in assisted living he said to me last year its hard to get a drink around here anyway but he still has an aa group that visits him there and so for me i believe that everyone in this country including the people in rural america have that same right to be pursued by grace,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator mr steyer how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in ohio and around the country please respond,6
Tom Steyer, well i think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that americas had 72000 people died of opioid overdoses last year and thats not only a tragedy for them its a tragedy for their family and their communities and so i think we have to treat this as a health crisis we have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people but i think that senator klobuchar makes a good point the reason im running for president is that we have a broken government and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it,6
Tom Steyer, every single one of these conversations is about that broken government its about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want its about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want we need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government ive put forward actual structural changes including term limits a national referendum the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of american citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote these corporations have taken over our government and 72000 deaths this year are the tragic result,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr steyer mr yang you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids including heroin how would that solve the crisis,6
Andrew Yang, thats exactly right and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amuck there was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of ohio than human beings in the state of ohio and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate they ended up levying a 600 million fine against purdue pharma which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made 30 billion they got a 2 fine and they killed tens of thousands of americans an hour so if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well even though this is not a money problem we all know this is a human problem,6
Andrew Yang, part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that theyre not going to be referred to a prison cell they will be referred to treatment and counseling i talked to an emt in new hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again because the fact is after you save someone whos oding you just bring them back to their house and they od again the following week so we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use we have to let the country know this is not a personal failing this was a systemic government failing and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr yang congressman orourke is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution please respond,6
Beto O’Rourke, yes it is for many of the reasons that mr yang just described and also just from some personal experiences ive had as a member of congress where constituents of mine have come forward in some cases publicly at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions i remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the va now imagine that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in america insured the va could prescribe it expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted,6
Beto O’Rourke, i also want to agree with senator klobuchar until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions purdue pharma johnson amp johnson were going to continue to have this problem going on again so that veteran that i met and anyone with drug addiction today is not a problem for the criminal justice system theyre an opportunity for our public health system ,6
Marc Lacey, senator harris you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail,6
Kamala Harris, i am and i will tell you as a former prosecutor i do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability because they are nothing more than some high level dope dealers they have been engaged  and ive seen it happen before ive taken on the pharmaceutical companies when i was attorney general of california and led the second largest department of justice ive seen what they do the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited 72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis which is a public health epidemic,6
Kamala Harris, and they knew what they were doing they were marketing false advertising they knew what they were pushing in communities and states like ohio without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks and yes they should be held accountable this is a matter of justice and so as as president of the united states i would ensure that the united states department of justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal lets end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and lets go after these pharmaceutical companies for what theyve been doing to destroy our country in states like ohio,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator secretary castro are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison please respond,6
Julian Castro, yes i am they need to be held accountable not only financially but also criminal penalties you know you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable whether its these drug manufacturers or wall street executives that should have been held accountable a decade and a half ago,6
Marc Lacey, thank you,6
Erin Burnett, now to the issue of candidates and their health senator sanders i want to start with you i want to start  were moving on senator im sorry,6
Bernie Sanders, im healthy im feeling great but i would like to respond to that question,6
Erin Burnett, i want to start by saying ,6
Senator Booker, and senator sanders is in favor of medical marijuana i want to make sure thats clear as well,6
Bernie Sanders, thank you,6
Erin Burnett, senator sanders this debate does mark your,6
Bernie Sanders, im not on it tonight ,6
Erin Burnett,  this debate sir does mark your return to the campaign trail go ahead and finish your point and then ill ask my question senator,6
Bernie Sanders, im more than happy to answer your question but i wanted to pick up on what kamala and cory and others have said lets take a deep breath take a look at this opioid epidemic you have the executive ceos of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year and in this particular case with the opioids they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them last year the top 10 drug companies made 69 billion in profit this is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country and its not just the drug companies right now the ceos in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world and they continue to make huge profits,6
Erin Burnett, senator,6
Bernie Sanders, that is why we need a political revolution,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator,6
Bernie Sanders,  that says enough is enough to this behavior,6
Erin Burnett, senator we are all very glad youre feeling well as youve just said but there is a question on a lot of peoples minds and i want to address it tonight youre 78 years old and you just had a heart attack how do you reassure democratic voters that youre up to the stress of the presidency,6
Bernie Sanders, well let me invite you all to a major rally were having in queens new york berniesanderscom were going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country that is how i think i can reassure the american people but let me take this moment if i might to thank so many people from all over this country including many of my colleagues up here for their love for their prayers for their well wishes i just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and im so happy to be back here with you this evening,6
Erin Burnett, vice president biden if youre elected you will turn 80 during your first term last month former president jimmy carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old why are you so sure that you can,6
Joe Biden, because ive watched it i know what the job is ive been engaged look one of the reasons im running is because of my age and my experience with it comes wisdom we need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage command the respect of world leaders from putin to our allies and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track it is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one thats one of the reasons why i decided to run why i decided to run this time because of i know what has to be done ive done it before ive been there,6
Joe Biden, when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history ive been there and ive got so many pieces of legislation passed including the affordable care act as well as making sure that we had the recovery act which kept us from going into depression i know what has to be done i will not need any on the job training the day i take office and i will release my medical records as i have 21 years of my tax records which no one else on this stage has done so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what i am doing,6
Erin Burnett, just to be clear mr vice president when will you release those records,6
Joe Biden, before the first vote,6
Erin Burnett, before iowa,6
Joe Biden, yes,6
Erin Burnett, not by the end of this year,6
Joe Biden, before iowa i mean look ive released them before i released 55 pages of my  im the only guy thats released anything up here,6
Erin Burnett, senator warren like senator sanders and vice president biden if you win the presidency you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated on a first term youll be 71 40 of democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat president trump what do you say to them,6
Senator Warren, well i say i will outwork outorganize and outlast anyone and that includes donald trump mike pence or whoever the republicans get stuck with look the way i see this the way were going to win is by addressing head on what millions of americans know in their bones and that is that the wealthy and the wellconnected have captured our democracy and theyre making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind political pundits and washington insiders and shoot people in our own party dont want to admit that,6
Senator Warren, they think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy they are wrong if all democrats can promise is after donald trump it will be business as usual then we will lose democrats win when we call out whats broken and we show how to fix it democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch peoples lives things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator warren congresswoman gabbard youre 38 years old and you would be the youngest president if elected should age matter when choosing a president,6
Tulsi Gabbard, im glad you asked because i was going to say its not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us i am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape but heres the real question i believe you should be asking is who is fit to serve as our commanderinchief this is the most important responsibility that the president has what donald trump has been doing in syria and what we have just seen with him inviting turkey to come in and slaughter the kurds show what an unfit president looks like it it highlights how critical is that we have a president and commanderinchief whos ready on day one bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security,6
Tulsi Gabbard, bringing the experience that i have both serving in congress now for nearly seven years serving on the foreign affairs committee serving on the armed services committee subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats serving on the homeland security committee the experience that i have as a soldier serving for over 16 years in the army national guard deploying twice to the middle east being able to serve in different capacities joint training exercises training the kuwait national guard i understand the importance of our national security i am prepared to do this job to fulfill this responsibility as commanderinchief on day one,6
Erin Burnett, thank you congresswoman,6
Tulsi Gabbard, id like to ask our other candidates this question id like to start with senator warren,6
Erin Burnett, sorry congresswoman im sorry,6
Tulsi Gabbard,  what her experience and background is to serve as commanderinchief,6
Erin Burnett, im sorry thank you were going to take another break now the cnn new york times debate live from otterbein university here in ohio well be back in just a few moments,6
Anderson Cooper, welcome back to the cnn new york times democratic presidential debate marc lacey from the new york times starts off our questioning marc,6
Marc Lacey, thank you lets turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies mr yang senator warren is calling for companies like facebook amazon and google to be broken up is she right does that need to happen,6
Andrew Yang, as usual senator warren is 100 right in diagnosing the problem there are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move but we also have to be realistic that competition doesnt solve all of the problems its not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app that would be like  theres a reason why no one is using bing today sorry microsoft its true so its not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive main street businesses around the country,6
Andrew Yang, and as the parent of two young children im particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children studies clearly show that were seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier what we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems were trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work we need new solutions and a new toolkit,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator warren is mr yang wrong your response please,6
Senator Warren, look im not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy its time to fight back think about it this way when you talk about how it works in competition about 8 9 of all retail sales happen in bricks and sticks stores happen at walmart about 49 of all sales online happen in one place thats amazon it collects information from every little business and then amazon does something else it runs the platform gets all the information and then goes into competition with those little businesses look you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team but you dont get to do both at the same time we need to enforce our antitrust laws break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech big pharma big oil all of them,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator warren mr steyer your response,6
Tom Steyer, look i agree with senator warren that in fact monopolies have to be dealt with they either have to be broken up or regulated and thats part of it but we have to understand that mr trump is going to be running on the economy hes going to be saying hes the person who can make it grow i started a business from scratch one room no employers and built a multibillion dollar international business were going to have to show the american people that we dont just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity talk about investing in the american people talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the american private sector,6
Tom Steyer, in fact if we want to beat mr trump i think somebody who can go toe to toe with them and show them to be a fraud and a failure as a business person and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the american economy is going to be necessary he is one his tax plans a failure his trade war is a failure i would love to take him on as a real businessman and show,6
Tom Steyer,  i would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that in fact hes failed the american people and he has to go,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr steyer,6
Marc Lacey, senator booker how do you respond would a president booker break up big tech companies like facebook and amazon,6
Senator Booker, anybody that does not think that we hae a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used not just in terms of anticompetitive practices but also to undermine our democracy we have seen it in the 16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now we need regulation and reform antitrust i mean robert bork right now is laughing in his sleep we have a reality in this country where antitrust from pharma to farms is causing trouble we have to deal with this as president of the united states i will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws,6
Senator Booker, i want to say one last thing and i feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage going back to the fact that we  its rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is donald trump,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Marc Lacey, congressman orourke you say youre not sure if its appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up whats the proper level of oversight here,6
Beto O’Rourke, yeah we need to set very tough very clear transparent rules of the road the kind of rules that we do not have today that allow these social media platforms where we the people have become the product to abuse that public trust to do so at extraordinary profits right now we treat them functionally as a utility when in reality theyre more akin to a publisher they curate the content that we see our pictures and personal information that they share with others we would allow no publisher to do what facebook is doing to publish that ad that senator warren has rightfully called out that cnn has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president treat them like the publisher that they are thats what i will do as president,6
Beto O’Rourke, we will be unafraid to breakup big businesses if we have to do that but i dont think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up thats something that donald trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power its not something that we should do,6
Beto O’Rourke, tough rules of the road protect your personal information privacy and data be fearless in the face of these tech giants,6
Marc Lacey, senator sanders your response,6
Bernie Sanders, when we talk about a rigged economy its not just the grotesque level of income in wealth and equality it is also the fact that in sector after sector whether it is wall street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the gdp of the united states whether it is media where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 of what the american people see hear or read whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family based farming in this country we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies protect small business and protect consumers by ending the price fixing which we see every day,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Kamala Harris, marc marc,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Marc Lacey, senator harris to you facebook ceo mark zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies wont be able to work together to fight it could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse,6
Kamala Harris, no i dont agree with that at all as serving on the senate intelligence committee working with amy klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure knowing that russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the united states and will attempt to do it again thats a ridiculous argument hes making,6
Kamala Harris, but i do want to also say this what were talking about is a grave injustice when rules apply to some but not equally to all in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless dont apply to the powerful,6
Kamala Harris, senator warren i just want to say that i was surprised to here that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies when i called on twitter to suspend donald trumps account that you did not agree i would urge you to join me because here we have donald trump who has 65 million twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the united states to openly intimidate witnesses to threaten witnesses to obstruct justice he and his account should be taken down,6
Kamala Harris, we saw in el paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how donald trump uses that platform this is a matter of corporate responsibility twitter should be held accountable and shutdown that site it is a matter of safety and corporate accountability,6
Marc Lacey, thank you,6
Marc Lacey, senator warren you can respond,6
Senator Warren, look i dont just want to push donald trump off twitter i want to push him out of the white house thats our job but the way,6
Kamala Harris, then join me if you dont,6
Senator Warren, but the way  but lets figure,6
Kamala Harris, join me in saying that his twitter account should be shut down,6
Senator Warren, no lets figure out,6
Kamala Harris, no,6
Senator Warren,  why it is that we have had laws on the book,6
Kamala Harris, wow,6
Senator Warren,  for antitrust for over a century yet for decades now weve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in washington big ag how the gun industry big tech we really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed,6
Kamala Harris, you cant say youre for corporate,6
Senator Warren, i announced this morning,6
Kamala Harris,  responsibility if it doesnt apply to everyone,6
Senator Warren, i announced this morning that im not going to take any money from big tech executives from wall street executives weve already agreed bernie and i were not taking any money from big pharma executives you cant go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws we need campaign finance rules and practices,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator warren,6
Senator Warren,   that support us all,6
Kamala Harris, it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people this is a matter you are saying of holding big tech accountable,6
Senator Warren, yes,6
Kamala Harris, holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on peoples perceptions about issues they actually influence behaviors we all have to agree this is their power it is immense,6
Marc Lacey,  senator klobuchar let me bring you in,6
Kamala Harris,  im not finished what i am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to twitter the same way it does to facebook,6
Senator Warren, look i think all of the rules should apply across the board i dont have a problem with that,6
Kamala Harris, so you will join me in saying,6
Senator Warren, what i do have a problem with,6
Kamala Harris,  twitter should shutdown that account,6
Senator Warren,  is that if were going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives i were going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives if we are going to talk about wall street and having some serious regulation over wall street we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives,6
Marc Lacey, thank you,6
Senator Warren, so long as thats,6
Marc Lacey, senator klobuchar  lets bring you in here,6
Amy Klobuchar,  i would like to have a different take on this i was in the private sector for 14 years represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market i had a life before government what i saw was when we got more competition there the prices went down in a big way in the longdistance market,6
Amy Klobuchar, well right now we have another gilded age going on i am the lead democrat on the antitrust committee i have the lead legislation which means one changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what weve been talking about here is breaking down some of this consolidation also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because theyre so overwhelmed but the issue here is this start talking about this as a pro competition issue this used to be a republican and democratic issue because america our founding fathers actually wanted to have less consolidation we were a place of entrepreneurship we are seeing a startup slump in this country,6
Marc Lacey, thank you senator,6
Amy Klobuchar,  and this means,6
Marc Lacey, secretary castro would you like to,6
Amy Klobuchar,  everything from tech on down,6
Marc Lacey,  weigh in please respond,6
Julian Castro, yeah i think that were on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices setting as congressman orourke said rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today whether thats amazon that is leveraging its size i think to help put small businesses out of business then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers not paying them as they should not giving them the benefits that they should or its a number of other companies big tech companies we need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices thats what i would do as president,6
Marc Lacey, thank you mr secretary,6
Andrew Yang,  the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property right now our data is worth more than oil how many of you remember getting your data check in the mail it got lost it went to facebook amazon google if we say this is our property and we share in the gains thats the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr yang,6
Kamala Harris, theres a bigger issue here,6
Erin Burnett, turning to womens reproductive rights ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy many women dont even know they are pregnant at that time the ohio law like many others is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect senator harris if states prevail on restricting abortion whats your plan to stop them,6
Kamala Harris, my plan is as follows for any state that passes a law that violates the constitution and in particular roe v wade our department of justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with roe v wade and the constitution if it is not that law will not go into affect thats called preclearance,6
Kamala Harris, because the reality is that while we still have as i said earlier these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies then there needs to be accountability and consequence,6
Kamala Harris, but ill go further you may have seen i questioned brett kavanaugh when i was a member of the senate judiciary committee asked him as a nominee to serve on the united states supreme court could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body the answer was uh uh no the reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in america women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species our bodies were created to do that it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body it is her body it is her right it is her decision,6
Erin Burnett, senator harris thank you,6
Erin Burnett, senator klobuchar what would you do to stop states from prevailing your response,6
Amy Klobuchar, i would codify roe v wade and make it the law of the land but what i want to do right now is just say what if donald trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me you know what i would say to him id say you know you said you wanted to do this in your race for president you actually said that you wanted to put women in jail then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail that is exactly what the alabama law is it put doctors in jail for 99 years you donald trump are not on the side of women you are not on the side of people of this country when over 75 of people want to keep roe v wade on the book when over 90 of people want to make sure we have available contraception you defunded planned parenthood i would fund it again,6
Erin Burnett, senator thank you,6
Erin Burnett, senator booker if states prevail on restricting abortion how would you stop them please respond,6
Senator Booker, well first of all lets be clear about these laws we see from alabama to ohio theyre not just a tax on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country liberty the ability to control your own body but they are particular another example of people trying to punish trying to penalize trying to criminalize poverty because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country people in rural areas in this country it is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body,6
Senator Booker, the way as president of the united states im going to deal with this is first of all elevating it like we have with other national crises to a white house level position i will create the office of reproductive freedom and reproductive rights in the white house make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt thats gone on for decades to undermine roe v wade i will fight to codify it i will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the hyde amendment so that we are leading the planet earth in defending the global,6
Erin Burnett, thank you senator,6
Senator Booker,  assault we see on women right now,6
Erin Burnett, congresswoman gabbard your response,6
Tulsi Gabbard, this is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make its unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon i agree with hillary clinton on one thing disagree with her on many others but when she said abortion should be safe legal and rare i think shes correct we see how the consequences of laws that youre referring to can often lead to a dangerous place as weve seen them as theyre passed in other countries where a woman who has a miscarriage passed that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point,6
Tulsi Gabbard, i do however think that there should be some restrictions in place i support codifying roe v wade while making sure that during the third trimester abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk,6
Erin Burnett, thank you very much,6
Erin Burnett, the supreme court is currently made up of five republican appointed justices and four appointed by democrats the court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights vice president biden the constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the supreme court if roe v wade is overturned on your watch and you cant pass legislation in congress would you seek to add justices to the supreme court to protect womens reproductive rights,6
Joe Biden, i would not get in a court  we had three justices next time around we lose control they had three justices we began to lose any credibility the court has at all,6
Joe Biden, i want to point out that the justices ive supported  when i defeated robert bork and i say when i defeated robert bork i made sure we guaranteed a womans right to chose for a better part of a generation i would make sure that we move and insist that we codify roe v wade the public is already there things have changed i would go out and i would campaign against those people in the state of ohio alabama et cetera who in fact are throwing up this barrier reproductive rights are a constitutional right in fact every woman should have that right i would not pack the court what i would do is make sure that the people that i recommended for the court from ruth bader ginsburg to elena kagan who used to work for me to others that they in fact support the right of privacy on which the entire notion of a womans right to choose is based thats what i would do no one would get on the court ,6
Joe Biden, by the way if in fact at the end of this  the beginning of next year if in fact one of the justices steps down god forbid in fact i would make sure that we would do exactly what mcconnell did last time out we would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mr vice president,6
Erin Burnett, mayor buttigieg you have discussed expanding the court from nine to 15 justices whats your response to the vice president,6
Pete Buttigieg, thats right when i proposed reforming the supreme court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate now im not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me although i certainly will appoint people who share my values for example the idea that womens reproductive freedom is an american right what im talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court we cant go on like this where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next,6
Pete Buttigieg, now one way to fix this would be to have a 15 member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10 smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the yale law journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment but the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis there are other reforms that we could consider from term limits dont forget justices used to just retire like everybody else to a rotation off the appellate bench,6
Erin Burnett, thank you,6
Pete Buttigieg, im not wedded to a particular solution but i am committed to establishing a commission on day one,6
Erin Burnett, thank you mayor buttigieg,6
Pete Buttigieg,  that will propose reforms to depoliticize the supreme court because we cant go on like this,6
Erin Burnett, thank you very much mayor buttigieg,6
Erin Burnett, secretary castro hes talking about making the court bigger your response is it a good idea,6
Julian Castro, i dont think it is i wouldnt pack the court i think the plan that mayor pete mentioned is an interesting one but i actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective,6
Julian Castro, i would also make sure that i appoint as president people who respect the precedent of roe v wade that we codify roe v wade that we do away with things like the hyde amendment because you shouldnt only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money we have to think about people who do not people who are poor we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom but also reproductive justice invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met,6
Erin Burnett, senator warren would you consider adding more justices to the supreme court to protect roe v wade your response,6
Senator Warren, i think there are a number of options i think as mayor buttigieg said there are many different ways people are talking about different options i think we may have to talk about them but on roe versus wade can we just pause for a minute here i lived in an america where abortion was illegal rich women still got abortions because they could travel they could go to places where it was legal what were talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor are the young are 14 year olds who were molested by a family member we now have support across this country three out of four americans believe in the rule of roe versus wade when youve got three out of four americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through congress,6
Erin Burnett, senator thank you,6
Senator Warren, we should not leave this to the supreme court we should do it through democracy because we can,6
Erin Burnett, thank you very much senator,6
Anderson Cooper, as some of you have indicated the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and president trump there are however fundamental differences between many of you on this stage vice president biden just on either side of you senator warren is calling for big structural change senator sanders is calling for a political revolution will their visions attract the kind of voters that the democrats need to beat donald trump,6
Joe Biden, well i think there vision is attracting a lot of people i think a lot of what they have to say is really important but as senator warren said we cant be running any vague campaigns we got to level with people weve got to level with people and tell them exactly what were going to do how were going to get it done if you can get it done,6
Joe Biden, im going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but im the only one on this stage thats gotten anything really big done from the violence against women act to making sure that we passed the affordable care act to be in a position where we in fact took almost a 90 billion dollar act that kept us from going into a depression putting us in a position where i was able to end roe  excuse me able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons the question is who is best prepared we all have good ideas the question is whos going to be able to get it done how can you get it done,6
Joe Biden, im not suggesting they cant but im suggesting that thats what we should look at part of that requires you not being vague tell people what its going to cost how youre going to do it and why youre going to do it thats the way to get it done presidents are supposed to be able to persuade,6
Anderson Cooper, just to clarify vice president who are you saying is being vague,6
Joe Biden, well the senator said  shes being vague on the issue of  actually both of them are being vague on the issue of the medicare for all now look heres the deal come on it costs 30 trillion dollars guess what thats over three trillion dollars a year its part of the entire budget let me finish okay,6
Anderson Cooper, youll both get a ,6
Joe Biden, if you eliminated the entire pentagon every single thing planes ship troop the building everything satellites it would get you and pay for a total of four months four months where do you get the rest wheres it come from,6
Bernie Sanders, two things let me respond,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders respond,6
Bernie Sanders,  in two ways joe you talked about working with republicans and getting things done but you know what you also got done i say this as a good friend you got the disastrous war in iraq done you got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country you got trade agreements like nafta and pntr with china done which have cost us four million jobs,6
Bernie Sanders, now lets get to medicare for all lets be honest we spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on earth the answer is if we have the guts that i would like to see the democratic have that guts to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people not to make 100 billion dollars in profit,6
Anderson Cooper, senator thank you senator,6
Bernie Sanders, if we stood together we could create the greatest healthcare system in the world,6
Anderson Cooper, vice president biden you can respond and then senator warren,6
Joe Biden, we can do that without medicare for all we can do that by adding a  public option we can,6
Bernie Sanders, no you cant,6
Joe Biden, we can afford to do it we can afford,6
Bernie Sanders, youve got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the,6
Joe Biden, by the way,6
Bernie Sanders,  healthcare industry,6
Joe Biden,  the greed and the profiteering,6
Anderson Cooper, let him respond,6
Joe Biden, let me finish,6
Anderson Cooper, vice president,6
Joe Biden, the greed and profiteering of those insurance companies they are as much against my bill as they are anybody elses they were strongly against obamacare they know it cost them its going to take away the right of people to choose the 160 million people out there whove negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it they should have a right to keep it,6
Anderson Cooper, senator warren your response,6
Senator Warren, you started this question with how you got something done following the financial crash of 2008 i had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people all of the washington insiders and strategic geniuses said dont even try because you will never get it passed sure enough the big banks fought us the republicans fought us some of the democrats fought us but we got that agency passed into law it has now forced big banks to return more than 12 billion dollars directly to people they cheated,6
Senator Warren, i served in the obama administration i know what we can do by executive authority and i will use it in congress on the first day i will pass my anticorruption bill which will beat back the influence of money,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Warren,  and repeal the filibuster the third we want to get something done in america we have to get out there,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Warren,  and fight for the things that touch peoples lives,6
Anderson Cooper,  mayor,6
Joe Biden, i agreed with  let me  she referenced me,6
Anderson Cooper, okay,6
Joe Biden, i agreed with the great job she did i went on the floor and got you votes i got votes for that bill i convinced people for it so lets get those things straight too,6
Anderson Cooper, senator warren do you want to respond,6
Senator Warren, i am deeply grateful to president obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law i am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law but understand,6
Joe Biden, you did a hell of a job in your job,6
Senator Warren, thank you but understand this it was a dream big fight hard people told me go for something little go for something small go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator,6
Senator Warren, i said no lets go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy,6
Anderson Cooper, senator thank you,6
Senator Warren, president obama said i will fight for that he sometimes,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor,6
Senator Warren,  had to fight against people in his own administration we have to,6
Joe Biden, not me,6
Senator Warren,  be willing to make good,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor,6
Senator Warren,  big structural change,6
Anderson Cooper, mayor buttigieg which is the right vision for a democrat to beat donald trump thats the essential question,6
Pete Buttigieg, if i had a buck for every argument that ive witnessed like this i could pay for college for everybody we need to move passed what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as ive been alive,6
Pete Buttigieg, were being offered a false choice i dont agree with the vice president that trump is an aberration i dont agree that theres any such thing as back to normal because here in the industrial midwest definitely where i live normal didnt work thats part of how we got here thats part of how a guy like donald trump managed to get within cheating distance of the oval office in the first place,6
Pete Buttigieg, but i also dont agree with senator warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat yes we have to fight absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand but its going to take more than fighting,6
Pete Buttigieg, once again i want to take you back to that day after trump has stopped being president think about what the president can do to unify a new american majority for some of the boldest things weve attempted in my lifetime medicare for all who want it actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the 80s an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal making college free for low and middle income students yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesnt count unless we go even further free college for low and middle income students isnt good enough unless were also paying for the children of billionaires immigration reform isnt enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings,6
Pete Buttigieg, we have an opportunity to do the biggest things,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Pete Buttigieg,  weve done in my lifetime,6
Anderson Cooper, senator,6
Joe Biden,  i did not say back to normal,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mayor,6
Senator Warren,   he called me out by name,6
Anderson Cooper, senator klobuchar,6
Amy Klobuchar, thank you,6
Anderson Cooper, senator klobuchar,6
Amy Klobuchar, this isnt a fly over part of the country to me the heartland is where i live i want to win those states that we lost last time i have bold ideas to get us there i think just because theyre different than elizabeths doesnt mean theyre bold but we cant get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win,6
Amy Klobuchar, what i have done is win the only one up here time and time again the reddest of red districts michele bachmanns i won that district three times rural districts that border iowa and north and south dakota i do it by going not just where its comfortable but where its uncomfortable that is why i have been in pennsylvania and in michigan and in wisconsin and all over ohio and in iowa because i think we need to build a blue democratic wall around those states and,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you,6
Amy Klobuchar,  make donald trump pay for it,6
Anderson Cooper, senator warren she referenced you so you can respond,6
Senator Warren, people who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today people who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today people who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today anyone who doesnt understand that americans are already in these fights is not someone whos likely to win them for me this is about knowing whats broken knowing how to fix it yes im willing to get out there and fight for it,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders,6
Pete Buttigieg, but theres a missing piece,6
Anderson Cooper,  senator sanders why is your approach more likely to beat president trump,6
Bernie Sanders, ill tell you why,6
Anderson Cooper, please,6
Bernie Sanders,  heres the radical reason why its what the american people want,6
Senator Warren, yes,6
Bernie Sanders, all right the american people do not want tax breaks for billionaires they want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes poll came out yesterday 71 of democrats support medicare for all the people of this country understand that we got to make public colleges and universities tuition free more and more americans including republicans understand we need bold action if were going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren the way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old same old you have to inspire people you have to excite people you got to bring working people and young people and poor people into,6
Anderson Cooper, senator thank you,6
Bernie Sanders,  the political process,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman,6
Bernie Sanders, because they know you stand for them not corporate america,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman orourke is political revolution what the american people want your response,6
Beto O’Rourke, there was some talk about getting big things done when i was first elected to congress i found that el paso texas had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental healthcare provider at the va i dont know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in el paso but it was important to those veterans who i served we set about turning around the va hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men whod put their lives on the line for this country,6
Beto O’Rourke, we were able to do that we took what we learned and we applied it to a national law as a member of the minority working with republicans and democrats alike to expand mental healthcare access for veterans nationally,6
Beto O’Rourke, then in texas one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country going to every single county,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congressman,6
Beto O’Rourke,  talking about this progressive agenda and winning more votes than any democrat has ever won thats the way that we defeat donald trump in,6
Anderson Cooper, congressman orourke thank you,6
Beto O’Rourke,  november of 2020,6
Anderson Cooper, we have to take a quick break the cnnnew york times debate live from ohio will continue right after this,6
Anderson Cooper, music,6
Anderson Cooper, were back for the cnn new york times democratic presidential debate we have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on last week ellen degeneres was criticized after she and former president george w bush were seen laughing together at a football game ellen defended their friendship saying were all different and i think that weve forgotten that thats okay that were all different so in that spirit wed like you to tell us about a friendship that youve had that would surprise us what impacts its had on you and your beliefs secretary castro begin with you,6
Julian Castro, well first of all thank you to mark thank you anderson and thank you aaron and cnn and new york times and everybody whos here tonight some of the most interesting friendships that ive had have been with people different from me either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me also teachers as i was growing up people that had a life experience that when i was growing up was beyond mine and sometimes also and this goes to the heart of your question i think people who thought differently from me folks that i considered and have considered friends and i think that theres a value to that i think that that should be reflected more in our public life i also believe to just speak about the incident last week with ellen and george w bush i completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others,6
Julian Castro, i believe that we should be more kind to other folks i also believe that we should hold people to account for what theyve done especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something and i think that we can do both of those things i think that we can kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions and their people whether its our former president george w bush or others that should be held accountable just as we should be kind we shouldnt be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what theyve done,6
Anderson Cooper, congresswoman gabbard,6
Tulsi Gabbard, thank you know where i come from in hawaii many of you know we greet each other with aloha its not a word that means hello and goodbye it actually means something much more powerful than that it means i come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected we are all brothers and sisters we are all gods children so ive developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the washington circles especially with republicans like trey gowdy for example he and i disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues weve developed a friendship thats based on respect and hes been there for me during some personally challenging times the challenge before us today is that our country is very divided donald trump must be defeated but we must do more than just defeat donald trump we need to deliver a win for the american people,6
Tulsi Gabbard, we must stand united as americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters that we are all connected this is the kind of leadership that i seek to bring as president inspired by the example of presidents like abraham lincoln who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all when i look out at our country i dont see deplorables i see fellow americans people who i treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly i will work to restore a white house that represents light and compassion and respect for every american regardless of race religion orientation gender or political affiliation so i want to ask everyone to join me join me in bringing about this government of by and for the people that serves all the people of this country and visit my website tulsi2020com for more information,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you congresswoman senator klobuchar,6
Amy Klobuchar, for me its john mccain and i miss him every day i traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me hed say senator klobuchar is a lead democrat on this trip and she will go next and i still remember being there at his ranch john and i went to visit him and cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk and the word said this there is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself thats what were doing right now and while we have had major debates about policy we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us and we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy but to change the tone in our politics to look up from our phones to look at each other to start talking to each other because the way we win and not just win the presidency but take back the us senate is by winning big,6
Amy Klobuchar, and the way we win big is with that fired up democratic base thats out there today but it is also about bringing in independence and moderate republicans i can lead this and i asked you to join me because ive done it before and i will do it again amyklobucharcom join our team thank you,6
Anderson Cooper, senator thank you very much mr steyer tell us about your most surprising friendship,6
Tom Steyer, im friends with a woman from denmark south carolina md ana berry whos fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community shes a different gender shes a different race shes from a different part of the country but she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor my mother was a school teacher in the new york public schools and in the brooklyn house of detention my father was the first generation in his family to go to college my grandfather was a plumber he interrupted his law degree to go into the navy in world war ii and he ended up prosecuting the nazis at nuremberg and when i asked him what that experience meant he said when you see something wrong in your society you fight it from the first day and every single day after and thats why i started the need to impeach movement two years ago because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 pennsylvania avenue,6
Tom Steyer, and over 10 years ago i saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every american in terms of the climate crisis and ive been fighting those companies with the help of the american people ever since successfully and thats why im running for president because our government has failed its been taught by corporations and its absolutely essential to return power to the people i have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do which is to take on the biggest problems in america directly and fight for them every single day,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you mr steyer congressman orourke,6
Beto O’Rourke, ive always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences i did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in el paso texas did it as a member of the city council where i saw my colleagues not as republicans or democrats but my fellow el pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community as a member of congress i remember being in san antonio i was visiting the va there march of 2017 i found that my flight had been snowed in washington dc happened to be in the elevator with a republican member of congress will hurd and on a whim i said do you want to just rent a car and drive from san antonio to washington and he called my bluff we got in that chevy impala last car on the lot it was spring break drove 1600 miles across the country live streamed the conversation a republican and a democrat finding out what we had in common,6
Beto O’Rourke, by the end of that trip not only had we formed a friendship but we had formed trust we worked with each other on each others bills i got will to work with me on an immigration bill showing party leaders from either side that republicans and democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue and then across texas i mentioned winning more votes than in any democrat we want independence and republicans in record numbers as well i will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that america rises to this opportunity,6
Anderson Cooper, senator booker tell us about your most surprising friendships,6
Senator Booker, well look i have so many i dont even know where to count i was the mayor of a large city with a republican governor he and i had to form a friendship even though i can write a dissertation on our disagreements when i got to the united states senate i went there with a purpose of making friendships across the aisle i go to bible study and chairman in hoffs office he and i passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids i went out to try to invite every one of my republican colleagues to dinner and let me again say finding a dinner in a restaurant agreeing on one with ted cruz was a very difficult thing im a vegan and hes a meat eating texan but ill tell you this right now this is the moment in america that this is our test the spirit of our country i believe in the values of rugged individualism and selfreliance but think about our history,6
Senator Booker, rugged individualism didnt get us to the moon it didnt beat the nazis it didnt map the human genome it didnt beat jim crow everything we did in this country big and vice president we have done so many big things the fact that theres an openly gay man now black woman all of us on the stage or because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose this election is not a referendum on one guy in one office its a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other the next leader is going to have to be one amongst us democrats that can unite us all not throw elbows at other democrats that are unfair because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country teach us a more courageous empathy and remind america that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women and love is not sentimentality its not anemic love is struggle,6
Senator Booker, love is sacrifice love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the declaration of independence that if were ever going to make it as a nation we must mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor i am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in not like i do please join me by going to corybookercom thank you,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator mr yang,6
Andrew Yang, first i want to thank all the voters tuned in at home if you dont feel like you got your question answered tonight its understandable there are 12 of us im going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours friday my website yang2020com and if you ask your question tonight theres a better chance ill get to it my surprising friendship its been so much fun running for president because ive gotten to meet so many americans i never would have gotten to meet otherwise the friendship that sticks out for me guy named fred whos an avid trump supporter a trucker he let me ride in his truck for hours he spent some time in jail i heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs and im happy to say that after our ride together he actually said that he would move from donald trump to my campaign which was a thrill for me and weve remained in touch ever since,6
Andrew Yang, the truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in ohio and michigan and pennsylvania and wisconsin and iowa did not care about our political party the fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail call centers transportation as well as to white collar workers like attorneys pharmacists and radiologists it does not care about our party donald trump had a set of solutions in 2016 and what did he say he said were going to build a wall were going to turn the clock back were going to bring the old jobs back america we have to do the opposite of all of these things we have to turn the clock forward we have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible we have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value it is not left it is not right it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020,6
Anderson Cooper, mr yang thank you very much senator harris,6
Kamala Harris, thank you probably paul ryan actually i invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the united states he and i agree on almost nothing but we agreed on that and after we joined forces he said to me kamila you know appalachia loves this and it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and i guess thats why im running i do believe that to beat donald trump but also to heal our country we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and ill tell you my mother was 19 when she left india alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer,6
Kamala Harris, and so she arrived in california she was supposed to have an arranged marriage but she got involved in the civil rights movement she met my father and that produced my sister and me they got married but when i was five that marriage ended but my mother convinced us that we could do anything and so i became the first woman attorney general california the second black woman elected to the united states senate and i will tell you thats part of why im running because donald trump if he had his way my story would not be possible and i am running to make sure that that dream the american dream american values american ideals will always hold true and so thats what is at stake in this election and i believe i am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the american dream and the need to reclaim it,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator harris mayor buttigieg,6
Pete Buttigieg, well i think about the friendships that i formed in the military people who were radically different from me different generation different race definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives when they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire they didnt care if i was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend they didnt care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not we just learned to trust each other in fact the fact that i want every american to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why i believe national service is so important i guess ill follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to peteforamericacom and read all about it,6
Pete Buttigieg, its also about building a sense of belonging in this country because i think thats what friendship and thats what service can create and i think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are selfmedicating and were seeing a rise in the deaths from despair i believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country the purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president it is the unification of the american people and im asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the trump presidency pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future,6
Anderson Cooper, mr mayor thank you senator sanders,6
Bernie Sanders, when i was chairman of the senate committee on veterans affairs i tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern american history and i failed i only had two republicans to vote with me in the senate so we had to go back to the drawing board and i worked with john mccain and i certainly did not get in that legislation working with mccain all that i wanted but it turned out that we were able to pass a very very significant piece of legislation including 5 billion more for the veterans administration more recently i worked with a very conservative republican from utah mike lee and mike understood although he and i disagree on everything that the us involvement in the saudi led war in yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of yemen and for the first time in 45 years we were able to get the war powers act utilized and get the votes to get the us troops out of that area,6
Bernie Sanders, but i think at the end of the day what i appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that trump is fostering on our people the divisiveness trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion and there is no job that i would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man woman and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 a progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country,6
Anderson Cooper, senator sanders thank you senator warren,6
Senator Warren, you asked about a surprising friend for me it would be charles fried 27 years ago when i was under consideration for a job he was someone who had been george bush the first solicitor general a deeply principled republican and we didnt agree on much i was far more liberal than he was but he also was willing to listen to my work about whats happening to americas middle class and charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure i got the job i grew up out in oklahoma i have three older brothers they all served in the military two of the three are still republicans i love all three of my brothers and there are a lot of things that were divided on there are core things that we believe in together we want to see all of our children get a good start in life,6
Senator Warren, we dont want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare were willing to get out there for the things we believe in look people across this country whether theyre democrats independents or republicans they know whats broken they know that we have an america thats working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind people across this country regardless of party are ready to say no more we want an america that works for everyone 2020 is our moment in history it is a deep honor to be here to be in this fight i know whats broken i know how to fix it and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone,6
Anderson Cooper, thank you senator warren vice president biden,6
Joe Biden, this is reassuring in the fact that were all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle get things done no other way to get anything done in this country the two people maybe that surprised you the most were hes been mentioned twice but john mccain john mccain worked for me when he worked in the navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world we became close friends became very close friends with my wife jill visited our home he was there with his children and on his deathbed he asked me to do his eulogy i would say to john john you didnt see a war you never wanted a fight and hed say you didnt see a problem youd never wanted to solve but he was a great man of principle he was honorable he was honorable,6
Joe Biden, and one of the things thats the reason why im running we have to restore the soul of this country thats why im doing this in fact this president has ripped the soul out of this country divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous a liar he cheats he does not do anything to promote people generally secondly we have to rebuild the middle class and the only were going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle my dad used to say a jobs about a lot more than a paycheck joey its about your dignity we have to restore peoples dignity and lastly we have to unite the country because folks its time we stop walking around with our heads down we are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century,6
Joe Biden, so for gods sake get up get up and remember this is the united states of america theres nothing nothing were unable to do when we decide were going to do it nothing at all period,6
Anderson Cooper, candidates thank you that concludes the fourth democratic presidential debate we want to thank otterbein university for hosting us now please stay tuned for cnn for special coverage of tonights debate with jake tapper and chris cuomo,6
Jake Tapper, hello everyone im jake tapper at the democratic debate here in westerville ohio tonight,6
Rachel Maddow, were in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nations history ambassador gordon sondland delivered testimony today in the house impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that president trump withheld military aid to ukraine and a white house meeting with president zelensky because he wanted the ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit president trump politically senator warren you have said already that youve seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office you and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also us senators may soon have to take that vote will you try to convince your republican colleagues in the senate to vote the same way and if so how,7
Senator Warren, of course i will and the obvious answer is to say first read the mueller report all 442 pages of it that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice and when congress failed to act at that moment and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again and thats whats happened with ukraine we have to establish the principle no one is above the law we have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it but i want to add one more part based on todays testimony and that is how did ambassador sondland get there this is not a man who had any qualifications except one he wrote a check a million dollars and that tells us about whats happening in washington,7
Senator Warren, the corruption how money buys its way into washington you know i raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think theyre going to get ambassadorships on the other side and ive taken a pledge anyone who wants to give me a big donation dont ask to be an ambassador because im not going to have that happen i asked everyone whos running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far i hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder,7
Rachel Maddow, senator warren thank you senator klobuchar youve said that you support the impeachment inquiry but you want to wait for a senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president after the bombshell testimony of ambassador sondland today has that view changed for you,7
Amy Klobuchar, i have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and ive called for an impeachment proceeding i just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision but let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake this is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with ukraine but every step of the way puts his own private interests his own partisan interests his own political interests in front of our countrys interest and this is wrong this is a pattern with this man and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs leaving the kurds for slaughter sucking up to vladimir putin every minute of the day,7
Amy Klobuchar, that is what this guy does and i think it is very very important that we have a president thats going to put our country first i was thinking about this when i was at the carter presidential museum and on the wall are etched the words of walter mondale when he looked back at their four years not perfect and he said this we told the truth we obey the law we kept the peace we told the truth we obeyed the law we kept the peace that is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the united states,7
Rachel Maddow, senator thank you senator sanders id like to go to you americans are watching these impeachment hearings at the same time theyre also focused on their more immediate daily economic and family concerns how central should the presidents conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any democratic nominees campaign for president how central would it be to yours,7
Bernie Sanders, well rachel sadly we have a president who is not only a pathological liar he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of america but we cannot simply be consumed by donald trump because if we are you know what were going to lose the election right now youve got 87 million people who have no health insurance or underinsured we are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change you got 500000 people sleeping out on the street and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing what the american people understand is that the congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time in other words we can deal with trumps corruption but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country we also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt dominated by a handful of billionaires and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of america we can do it all when we rally the american people in the cause of justice,7
Rachel Maddow, mayor budttigieg let me put the same question to you how  campaign how central would it be to yours,7
Pete Buttigieg, well the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics and it is not a part of the campaign but the presidents conduct is the impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that were learning more about in the investigations but just to be clear the presidents already confessed to it on television but thats just part of what weve seen under normal circumstances a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all which was the president had to confess in writing in court to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans we are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the trump presidency comes to an end one way or the other,7
Pete Buttigieg, im running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the trump presidency is behind us which will be a tender moment in the life of this country and we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever and while doing it address big issues that didnt take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the trump presidency as a whole a climate approaching the point of no return the fact that weve still got to act on healthcare kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read and an economy where even when the dow jones is looking good far too many americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what theyve got,7
Rachel Maddow, mr mayor,7
Pete Buttigieg, those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president and will be at the heart of our campaign,7
Rachel Maddow, mr mayor thank you andrea,7
Andrea Mitchell, vice president biden youve suggested in your campaign that if you defeat president trump republicans will start working with democrats again but right now republicans in congress including some of whom youve worked with for decades are demanding investigations not only of you but also of your son how would you get those same republicans to work with you,7
Joe Biden, well look the next president of the united states is going to have to do two things defeat donald trump thats number one and number two going to have to be able to go into states like georgia and north carolina and other places and get a senate majority thats what ill do you have to ask yourself up here who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place to win the presidency in the first place and secondly who is most likely to increase the number of people who are democrats in the house and in the senate and by the way i learned something about these impeachment trials i learned number one that donald trump doesnt want me to be the nominee thats pretty clear,7
Joe Biden, he held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in  are getting killed by russian soldiers secondly i found out that vladimir putin doesnt want me to be president so ive learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held but the bottom line is i think we have to ask ourselves the honest question who is most likely to do what needs to be done produce a democratic majority in the united states senate maintain the house and beat trump,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator harris your thoughts about that,7
Kamala Harris, well first of all we have a criminal living in the white house and there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot and what we saw today is ambassador sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president from what we heard today the vice president the secretary of state and the chief of staff and so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward but it also points to another issue,7
Kamala Harris, and back to the question that you asked earlier which is what does this mean for the american people because what it means when i watch this is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in america the powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else because heres the thing for those working people who are working two and three jobs if they dont pay that credit card by the end of the month they get a penalty for the people who dont pay their rent they get evicted for the people who shoplift they go to jail we need the same set of rules for everybody and part of the reason im running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to america for all people and not just for some,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator senator warren you have cast yourself as a fighter if you were elected though you would be walking into an existing fight a country that is already very divided over the trump presidency among other things do you see that divide as permanent or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals,7
Senator Warren, so i think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us and that is that we want to build an america that works for the people not one that just works for rich folks you know i have proposed a two cent wealth tax that is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets your first 50 billion is free and clear but your 50 billionth and first dollar got to pitch in 2 cents and when you hit a billion dollars youve got to pitch in a few pennies more heres the thing doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone its about saying you built something great in this country good for you but you did it using workers all of us help pay to educate you did it using youre getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for you did it protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,7
Senator Warren, so when you make it big when you make it really big when you make it top one 10th of 1 big pitch in 2 cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it and heres the thing thats something that democrats care about independents care about and republicans care about because regardless of party affiliation people understand across this country our government is working better and better for the billionaires for the rich for the wellconnected and worse and worse for everyone else we come together when we acknowledge that and  real change,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator thank you senator booker do you agree with that strategy,7
Senator Booker, well first of all i think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country we actually have a real problem with the tax rates tax loopholes tax cheats and i dont agree with the wealth tax the way that elizabeth warren puts it but i agree that we need to raise the estate tax we need to tax capital gains as ordinary income real strategies will increase revenue but heres the challenge we as democrats need to fight for a just taxation system but as i travel around the country we democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well,7
Senator Booker, when i stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs half the church raised their hands if we as a country dont start if we as a party dont start talking not just about how to tax wealth but to give more people opportunities to create wealth to grow businesses to have their american dream because yeah we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour but the people in communities i frequent theyre not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages they want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth but they want to have equalities of opportunity and thats what our party has to be about as well,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator warren you wanted to respond,7
Senator Warren, sure so let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax two cents on the top one 10th of 1 in this country and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five that is transformative we can provide universal prek for every threeyearold and fouryearold in america we can stop exploiting the women largely black and brown women who do this work and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america we can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools we can make college tuition free for every kid we can put 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel student loan debt for 95 of the folks whove got it two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generations future,7
Andrea Mitchell, all right let me let senator booker respond,7
Senator Warren, sure,7
Senator Booker, you know again i agree with the need to do all of those things were all united in wanting to see universal preschool and ill fight for that were all united in wanting to fund hbcus heck i wouldnt be here if it wasnt for two parents that went to hbcus but the tax the way were putting the forward right now the wealth tax im sorry its cumbersome its been tried by other nations its hard to evaluate we can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation but again we as democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it,7
Senator Booker, look at vc dollars in this country 75 of them go to the three metropolitan areas there is worth in the inner city there is value in our rural areas if i am president of the united states were going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share but dear god were going to have pathways to prosperity for more americans were going to see a change in what we see right now small businesses new startups are going down in this country,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator senator warren,7
Senator Booker, we need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator warren briefly just your last thoughts on this,7
Senator Warren, so just the idea behind what is fair today the 99 in america are on track to pay about 72 of their total wealth in taxes,7
Senator Booker, im not disagreeing with that,7
Senator Warren, the top one 10th of 1 that i want to say pay two cents more theyll pay 32 in america im tired of freeloading billionaires i think its time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets,7
Senator Booker, but everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires everybodys tired of corporations paying zero taxes im not disagreeing with that,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you very much senator warren thank you mayor buttigieg you have said quote i will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point the republican party never stopped fighting president obama in his eight years in office so what would you do that president obama didnt do to change that,7
Pete Buttigieg, well as president obama commented recently we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago and to me the extraordinary potential of the moment were in right now is that there is an american majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didnt exist in the same way even a few years ago even on issues where democrats have been on defense like immigration and guns we have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize not polarize that majority for example on healthcare,7
Pete Buttigieg, the reason i insist on medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the american people around creating a version of medicare making it available to anybody who wants it but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not and i believe that commanding people to accept that option whether we wait three years as senator warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate is not the right approach to unify the american people around a very very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you mr mayor kristen welker,7
Kristen Welker, lets talk about medicare for all senator warren you are running on medicare for all democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care protecting obamacare democrats are divided on this issue what do you say to voters who are worried that your position on medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general elections,7
Senator Warren, i look out and i see tens of millions of americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just cant afford it people didnt take the test the doctor recommended because they just cant afford it so here is my plan lets bring as many people in and get as much help to the american people as we can as fast as we can on day one as president i will do bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and epipens thats going to save tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars for people,7
Senator Warren, im going to defend the affordable care act from the sabotage of the trump administration and in the first hundred days im going to bring in 135 million people into medicare for all at no cost to them everybody under the age of 18 everybody who has a family of four income less than 50000 im going to lower the age of medicare to 50 and expand medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care and then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it were going to vote and were going to want medicare for all,7
Kristen Welker, senator thank you senator senator sanders let me bring you into this conversation,7
Bernie Sanders, thank you i wrote the damn bill,7
Kristen Welker, and ask you the question i want to ask you the question this way senator sanders you describe your campaign including your plans for medicare for all as a political revolution president obama explicitly said the country is quote less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement the average american doesnt think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it end quote is president obama wrong,7
Bernie Sanders, no hes right we dont have to tear down the system but we do have to do what the american people want and the american people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel it is dysfunctional now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country and yet we got 87 million uninsured underinsured in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of canada or other countries 500 000 people go bankrupt because of medicallyrelated issues they come down with cancer and thats a reason to go bankrupt,7
Bernie Sanders, now some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry but you know what if you think back to fdr and if you think to jfk and harry truman and barack obama as a matter of fact people have been talking about healthcare for all well you know what i think now is the time and in the first week of my administration we will introduce medicare for all medicare for all that means no deductibles no copayments no outofpocket expenses thats where we got to go,7
Kristen Welker, thank you senator sanders vice president biden,7
Joe Biden, you know we can do this without charging people raising 30 40 trillion dollars the fact is that right now the vast majority of democrats do not support medicare for all it couldnt pass the united states senate right now with democrats it couldnt pass the house nancy pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense we should build on obamacare provide the plan i put forward before anybody in here adding a medicare option in that plan and not make people choose allow people to choose i should say if you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left you have to give up your private insurance 160 million people like their private insurance and if they dont like it they can buy into a medicarelike proposal in my plan drug prices go down premiums go down across the board but heres the deal they get to choose i trust the american people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies they want no competition and my friends say you have to only go medicare for all,7
Kristen Welker, vice president biden thank you ashley,7
Ashley Parker, congresswoman gabbard you have criticized hillary clinton as the quote personification of the rut that has sickened the democratic party what is the rut you see in the democratic party,7
Tulsi Gabbard, that our democratic party unfortunately is not the party that is of by and for the people it is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in washington represented by hillary clinton and others foreign policy by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests im running for president to be the democratic nominee that rebuilds our democratic party takes it out of their hands and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country a party that actually hears the voices of americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow americans who were calling for an end to this ongoing bush clinton trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars overthrowing dictators in other countries needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harms way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of american lives,7
Tulsi Gabbard, these are wars that have cost us as american taxpayers trillions of dollars since 911 alone dollars that have come out of our pockets out of our hospitals out of our schools out of our infrastructure needs as president i will end this foreign policy end these regime change wars work to end this new cold war and arms race and instead invest our hard earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving needs of the american people right here at home,7
Ashley Parker, thank you congresswoman senator harris any response,7
Kamala Harris, oh sure i think that its unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states who during the obama administration spent four years fulltime on fox news criticizing president obama,7
Tulsi Gabbard, thats ridiculous senator harris,7
Kamala Harris, who had spent fulltime criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the democratic party when donald trump was elected not even sworn in buddied up to steve bannon to get a meeting with donald trump in the trump tower fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal and then spends full time during the course of this campaign again criticizing the democratic party what we need on the stage on the november is someone who has the ability to win and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with donald trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together i believe i am that candidate,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator congresswoman gabbard ill give you a chance to respond,7
Tulsi Gabbard, what senator harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that im making the leadership and the change that im seeking to bring in our foreign policy which only makes me guess that she will as president continue the status quo continue the bushclinton trump foreign policy of regime change wars which is deeply destructive this is personal to me because i served in iraq i left my seat in the state legislature in hawaii volunteered to deploy to iraq where i served in a medical unit where every single day i saw the terribly high human cost of war i take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as commander in chief to lead our armed forces and to make sure always no im not going to put party interests first i will put the interests of the american people above all else,7
Ashley Parker, thank you congresswoman i want to briefly give senator harris a final second to respond,7
Kamala Harris, i believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people i spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom speaking five words kamala harris for the people and it was about all the people regardless of their race regardless of their gender regardless of where they live geographically regardless of the party with which theyre registered to vote or the language their grandmother speaks we need someone on this debate stage in november who has the ability to unify the country and to win the election and i believe again i am that candidate,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator,7
Kamala Harris, thank you,7
Ashley Parker, mr steyer you have denounced the special interests that pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to influence it but in fact you have spent over 300 million of your own money in support of your political goals how do you respond to critics who see you is the embodiment of a special interest,7
Tom Steyer, what ive done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary american citizens to take on unchecked corporate power we have a broken government in washington dc its been purchased by corporations over the last decade with the help of the american people we have taken on and beaten the oil companies we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies weve taken on and beaten utilities weve taken on and beaten the drug companies ive also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the united states last year nextgen america did the largest youth voter mobilization in american history,7
Tom Steyer, i also in partnership with seven national unions knocked on 15 million doors in 2016 and 10 million in 2018 what ive done is to try to push power down to the american people to take power away from the corporations whove bought our government and im talking now about structural reform in washington dc term limits if you want bold change in the united states youre going to have to have new and different people in charge im the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits vice president biden wont senator sanders wont even mayor pete buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change i would let the american people pass laws themselves through direct democracy its time to push the power back to the people,7
Ashley Parker, thank you mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, and away from dc,7
Ashley Parker, mr steyer thank you senator klobuchar a brief response,7
Amy Klobuchar, well im someone that doesnt come from money and i appreciate the work of mr steyer but right now we have a system thats not fair and its not just fair for money and so what i would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn citizens united thats what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics i have led the way on voting and i can tell you right now one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18 if we had a system like this and we did something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges and we did something significant about making sure we dont have money in politics from the outside stacey abrams would be governor of this state right now,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator,7
Amy Klobuchar, and thats what should have happened so while i appreciate his work i am someone that doesnt come from money i see my husband out there my first senate race i literally called everyone i knew and i set what is still an alltime senate record i raised 17000 from exboyfriends and id like to point out it is not an expanding base so i dont just think this with my head i feel it in my heart,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator klobuchar mr yang,7
Tom Steyer, since i was named id like to chime in here,7
Ashley Parker, mr yang youve made a virtue of your outsider status youve never served in the military or in government what has prepared you to respond to a terrorist attack or a major disaster,7
Andrew Yang, well first i just want to stick up for tom we have a broken campaign finance system but tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change and you cant knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way my opinion,7
Tom Steyer, thanks andrew,7
Andrew Yang, yeah no problem as commander in chief i think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century and what are those threats climate change artificial intelligence loose nuclear material military drones and nonstate actors and if you look up were in the process of potentially losing the ai arms race to china right now because they have more access to more data than we do and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of ai in a way that we are not we are 24 years behind on technology and i can say that with authority because we got rid of the office of technology assessment in 1995 think about that timing i guess they thought theyd invented everything the next commander in chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow and thats what ill bring to the table as commander in chief,7
Ashley Parker, thank you mr yang andrea,7
Andrea Mitchell, mayor buttigieg lets talk about your record as a candidate you were elected mayor in a democratic city receiving just under 11000 votes and in your only statewide race you lost by 25 points why should democrats take the risk of betting on you,7
Pete Buttigieg, because i have the right experience to take on donald trump i get that its not traditional establishment washington experience but i would argue we need something very different right now in order to defeat this president we need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that hes been appealing to i dont talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them i dont even golf as a matter of fact i never thought id be on a forbes magazine list but they did one of all the candidates by wealth and i am literally the least wealthy person on this stage i also wore the uniform of this country and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the oval office in the situation room and i know how to bring people together to get things done,7
Pete Buttigieg, i know that from the perspective of washington what goes on in my city might look small but frankly where we live the infighting on capitol hill is what looks small the usual way of doing business in washington is what looks small and i believe we to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience the experience on the ground solving problems working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government recognizing what is required of executive leadership and bringing that to washington so that washington can start looking a little more like our best run communities in the heartland before the other way around starts to happen,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you mayor,7
Pete Buttigieg, communities in the heartland before the other,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you mayor thank you mayor senator klobuchar you said this of mayor buttigieg quote of the women on the stage do i think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had no i dont maybe were held to a different standard senator what did you mean by that,7
Amy Klobuchar, first of all ive made very clear i think that pete is qualified to be up on this stage and i am honored to be standing next to him but what i said was true women are held to a higher standard otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president which we cant do because it has all been men and including all vice presidents being men and i think any working woman out there any woman thats at home knows exactly what i mean,7
Amy Klobuchar, we have to work harder and thats a fact but i want to dispel one thing because for so long why has this been happening i dont think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president i dont think you have to be the skinniest person i dont think you have the loudest voice on the stage i dont think that means that you will be the one that should be precedent i think what matters is if youre smart if youre competent and if you get things done,7
Amy Klobuchar, i am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead democrat in that gridlock of washington in congress on this stage i think youve got to win and i am the one mr vice president that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as the lead on a ticket every time i governed both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman cant beat donald trump nancy pelosi does it every single day,7
Andrea Mitchell, mr vice president just a quick response,7
Joe Biden, i think a womans qualified to be president and theres no reason why if you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them the reason why i think i should be president and be the nominee is number one i have brought people together my entire career in the united states senate ive passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined from the violence against women act to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to did to dealing with milosevic,7
Joe Biden, the whole range of things that ive been engaged in my whole career ive done it ive brought people together im always told by everybody on here things have changed you cant do that anymore if we cant i thought the question was initially ask of the senator how do you unify this country we have to unify this country i have done it i have done it repeatedly and lastly to be commander in chief theres no time for on the job training ive spent more time in the situation room more time abroad more time than anybody up here i know every major world leader they know me and they know when i speak if im the president united states who were four who were against and what well do and well keep our word,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you thank you vice president ashley,7
Ashley Parker, senator booker one of the defining characteristics of the trump is that the american people hear from him directly all the time about everything on twitter and just about everywhere else setting aside your views of his tone is that unfiltered communication something you as president would continue is this one of the norms broken by president trump that needed to change,7
Senator Booker, so look this president has broken norms as youve said he used this platform to demean degrade and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling but the next president whoever they are is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together this whole nation so absolutely in that office i will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together but its not for a kumbaya moment we are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together,7
Senator Booker, so absolutely when i was mayor of the largest city in my state and this is where i agree with mayor pete mayoral experience is very important and i happened to be the other road scholar mayor on this stage and what i learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal in my city we have racial divides we have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling the success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldnt be done when i am president united states my campaign from the very beginning has not changed my charge is to see a nation right now which has so much common pain to channel that back into a sense of common purpose and i will do whatever it takes bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator rachel,7
Rachel Maddow, chants of lock her up are still heard at president trumps rallies today now some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him theyve chanted lock him up at a recent world series game in washington and at a veterans day event in new york and senator sanders at at least two of your campaign events recently senator should democrats discourage this or are you okay with it,7
Bernie Sanders, well i think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law and what the american people are saying nobody is above the law and i think what the american people are also saying is in fact that if this president did break the law he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law but at the end of the day what we need to do is to bring our people together not just in opposition to trump the initial question i think that you wrote that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation you know what i kind of reject that i think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country majority of the american people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage when you talk about the climate crisis the overwhelming majority of the american people know that it is real they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry,7
Bernie Sanders, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel energy efficiency and sustainable energy even on issues like guns the american people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence so i believe yep weve got to deal with trump but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesnt just go to the people on top but to all us,7
Rachel Maddow, vice president biden let me ask you to pick up on the issue that senator sanders just raised about no one being above the law when president ford pardoned president nixon he said it was to heal the country would you support a potential criminal investigation into president trump after he leaves office even if you thought it might further inflame the countrys divisions,7
Joe Biden, look i would not direct my justice department like this president does id let them make their independent judgment i would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated thats not the role of the president of the united states its the attorney general of the united states not the presidents attorney private attorney and so i would whatever was determined by the attorney general i supported that i appointed let them make an independent judgment if that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it,7
Joe Biden, but i would not direct it and i dont think its a good idea that we model ourselves after trump and say lock him up look we have to bring this country together lets start talking civilly to people and tweeting the next president starts tweeting should anyway it just we look its about civility we have to restore the soul of this country and thats not who we are thats not who weve been thats not who we should be,7
Joe Biden, follow the law let the justice department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted period,7
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders let me ask you briefly to respond to that the difference of opinion there with vice president biden,7
Bernie Sanders, well i think joe is right i think that is the function of the attorney general but what i am of the opinion is that the american people now do believe and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television they do believe that we have a president who thinks hes above the law we have a president who is engaged in corruption we have a president who was obstructed justice and in my view somebody was a violated the emoluments clause i think joe is right that is the function of an independent department of justice but my inclination is that the american people do believe that this president is in violation of the law,7
Joe Biden, can i respond very quickly,7
Rachel Maddow, briefly senator,7
Joe Biden, distinction should he be impeached and should it be thrown out of office thats one question hes very close to impeaching hes indicted himself number two after hes thrown out of office or after hes defeated should he be then prosecuted should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president thats a judgment to be made by an attorney general,7
Rachel Maddow, mr vice president thank you ashley,7
Ashley Parker, we now focus on an issue facing and many americans childcare and paid family leave here in georgia the average price of infant daycare can be as much as 8500 per child per year thats more than in state tuition at a four year public college in georgia mr yang what would you do as president to ease that financial burden,7
Andrew Yang, there are only two countries in the world that dont have paid family leave for new moms the united states of america and papua new guinea that is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible i would pass paid family leave is one of the first things we do i have two kids myself who are four and seven one of whom is autistic and has special needs and its breaking families backs,7
Andrew Yang, we need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning because by the time theyre showing up to prek and kindergarten in many cases theyre already years behind studies have shown that two thirds of our kids educational outcomes are determined by whats happening to them at home this is stress levels number of words read to them as children type of neighborhood whether a parent has time to spend with them,7
Andrew Yang, so we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one 1000 a month for every american adult which would put in many cases 2000 a month into families pockets so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child we should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce many parents see that trade off and say if they leave the home and work theyre going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway in many cases itd be better if the parents stays home with the child,7
Ashley Parker, thank you mr yang sticking with this topic no parent in the united states is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby a number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this,7
Ashley Parker, senator harris youre one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave and senator klobuchar youre one of the candidates proposing up to three months i want to hear from both of you on this starting with you senator klobuchar why three months,7
Amy Klobuchar, i looked at this economically and i want to make sure of that we help people because its just pointed out we are way behind the curve our country is when it to providing paid family leave and childcare we must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big but what i had done with all of my plans is i have showed how im going to pay for them meticulously,7
Amy Klobuchar, i think that is really really important when we have a president in the white house right now who have told over 10000 lies so when you look at my website at amyklobucharcom you will see my plans and youre also going to see how im going to pay for it and i think that is so important because this president is literally increasing the debt treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day so yes my plan is three months i think thats good id love to do more,7
Amy Klobuchar, as ive said before id love to staple free diplomas under peoples chairs i just am not going to go for things and this is not im not talking about senator harriss plan here but im talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here i am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,7
Amy Klobuchar, i think that we have an obligation we have an obligation as a party to be yes fiscally responsible yes think big but make sure we have peoples backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for and that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free which i dont support to kicking 149 million off their health insurance for health insurance in four years i just think we have to be smart about how we do this,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator and senator harris why six months and also how would you pay for that,7
Kamala Harris, sure everybody please visit my website kamalaharrisorg for the details on everything i talk about six months so part of how i believe were going to win this election is it is going to be because we are focused on the future we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow,7
Kamala Harris, so on paid family leave it is no longer the case in america that people are having children in their 20s people are having children in their 30s often in their 40s which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents which requires a lot of work from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required much less the healthcare needs that are required,7
Kamala Harris, and what we are seeing in america today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work and many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether theyre going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on so six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of womens lives today,7
Kamala Harris, the reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in america we pass the equal pay act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar black women 61 cents native american women 58 cents latinos 53 cents,7
Kamala Harris, so but so my policy is about theres a whole collection of work that im doing that is focused on women and working women in america and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in america are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator kristen,7
Kristen Welker, mr steyer millions of working americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable especially in metropolitan areas it is particularly acute in your home state of california and places like los angeles and san francisco why are you the best person to fix this problem,7
Tom Steyer, when you look at inequality in the united states of america you have to start with housing where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life it determines where your kids go to school it determines the air you breathe where you shop how long it takes you to get to work what weve seen in california is as a result of policy we have millions too few housing units and that affects everybody in california,7
Tom Steyer, it starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of california i understand exactly what needs to be done here which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units,7
Tom Steyer, but the other thing thats going to be true about building these units is were going to have to build them in a way thats sustainable that in fact how we build units where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability,7
Tom Steyer, so we are going to have to direct dollars were going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities whove worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns that they have to change that and were going to have to force it and then were going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50 of their income on rent,7
Kristen Welker, thank you mr cyrus senator warren i see your hand raised,7
Senator Warren, yes think of it this way our housing problem in america is a problem on the supply side and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time affordable housing also private developers theyve gone up to the mansions theyre not building the little two bedroom one bath house that i grew up in garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers so ive got a plan,7
Senator Warren, for 32 million new housing units in america those are housing units for working families for the working poor for the poor poor for seniors who want to age in place for people with disabilities for people who are coming back from being incarcerated its about tenants rights but theres one more piece,7
Senator Warren, housing is how we build wealth in america the federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people youre cut out of the deal that was known as red lining when i built a housing plan its not only a housing plan about building new units its a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government sponsored discrimination how we need to address it and we need to say were going to reverse it,7
Kristen Welker, thank you senator senator booker,7
Senator Booker, im so grateful again as a mayor who was a mayor during the recession who was a mayor during a housing crisis who started my career as a tenants rights lawyer this are all good points but were not talking about something that is going on all over america which is gentrification and low income families being moved further and further out often compounding racial segregation and so all of these things we need to put more federal dollars in it but weve got to start empowering people,7
Senator Booker, we use our tax code to move wealth up the mortgage interest deduction my plan is very simple if youre a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount youre paying in the area meeting your rent that empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners and what that does is it actually slashes poverty 10 million people out and by the way for those people who are facing eviction it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord it is also low income families struggling to stay in their home,7
Kristen Welker, thank you senator rachel,7
Rachel Maddow, were going to take a quick break but we will be right back with these candidates from the msnbc washington post democratic candidates debate in atlanta georgia stay with us,7
Rachel Maddow, welcome back to the msnbc washington post democratic candidates debate lets get right back into it american farmers are struggling under the effects of president trumps trade war with china,7
Rachel Maddow, the trump administrations payments to farmers to offset those losses already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the obama administrations auto bailout mayor buttigieg would you continue those farm subsidies,7
Pete Buttigieg, we shouldnt have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldnt have been started in the first place i will support farmers but not long ago i was in boone iowa a guy came up to me he said i got my trump bailout check but i would have rather spent that money on conservation by the way this isnt even making farmers whole if youre in soybeans for example youre getting killed and its not just what this presidents done with the trade war and a lot of parts of the country,7
Pete Buttigieg, the worst thing is these socalled small refinery waivers which are killing those who were involved in ethanol look i dont think this president cares one bit about farmers he keeps asking them to take one for the team but more and more im talking to people in rural america who see that theyre not going to benefit from business as usual under this president,7
Pete Buttigieg, i believe that so many of the solutions lie with american farmers but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support but with making sure we do something about the consolidation the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to and american farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change,7
Pete Buttigieg, i believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big as symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country and its an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem,7
Rachel Maddow, im sorry to interrupt but i need you to answer the question would you continue those subsidies or not,7
Pete Buttigieg, yes but we wont need them cause were going to fix the trade war,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you sir the un recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis with drastic results already being felt climate is also an issue important to our audience we received thousands of questions from our viewers and many of them were about climate calista from minneapolis writes this out leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multidecade project spending far beyond even a two term presidency if you are elected president how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project congresswoman gabbard,7
Tulsi Gabbard, this is an issue that impacts all of us as americans and people all over the world this is not a democrat issue or republican issue this is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face these are the kinds of conversations that were having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have democrats republicans libertarians and independents coming together saying hey we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families that we have clean air to breathe that were able to raise our kids in a community thats safe,7
Tulsi Gabbard, it is the hyper partisanship in washington unfortunately that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that i bring bring about as president transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly 30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry instead of investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs a sustainable economy investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture,7
Tulsi Gabbard, that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you congresswoman i want to bring in mr steyer on this youve made climate change a central point of your political career to this issue of making change changes that last making changes that are permanent could you address that sir,7
Tom Steyer, rachel im the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me vice president biden wont say it senator warren wont say it its a state of emergency and i would declare a state of emergency on day one i would use the emergency powers of the presidency i know that we have to do this ive spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies stopping pipelines stopping fossil fuel plants ensuring clean energy across the country i know that we have to do this i also know that we can do this i would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well,7
Tom Steyer, we can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country i would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution which are low income black and brown communities and when we ask how are we going to pull this country together how about this we take on the biggest challenge in history we save the world and we do it together if you think that would pull america together i do,7
Rachel Maddow, quickly vice president biden you were name checked there id like to give you a chance to response,7
Joe Biden, yeah i was i think it is the existential threat to humanity its the number one issue and i might add i dont really need kind of a lecture from my friend while i was passing the first climate change bill and that politifact said was a game changer,7
Joe Biden, while i manage the 90 billion recovery plan investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time weve ever done it my friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of great britain produces i welcome him back into the fold here and hes been there for a long while but the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are lets get this straight i think it is the existential threat of our time,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you mr vice president,7
Tom Steyer, can i respond to that rachel,7
Rachel Maddow, you may respond mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, i came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels and we all have to come to the same conclusion that i came to over a decade ago if were waiting for congress to pass one of the bills and i know everybody on this stage cares about this but congress has never passed an important climate bill ever,7
Tom Steyer, this is a problem which continues to get worse thats why im saying its a state of emergency thats why im saying its priority one if it isnt priority one its not going to get done and this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront we have to make it the most important thing and we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the united states is we can be the moral leaders of the world again while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good paying jobs,7
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders im going to ask you to jump in here,7
Bernie Sanders, tom you stated you were talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency ive introduced legislation to just do that now i disagree with the thrust of the original question because your question has said what are we going to do in decades we dont have decades what the scientists are telling us we dont get our act together within the next eight or nine years were talking about cities all over the world major cities going on the water were talking about increased drought talking about increased extreme weather disturbances,7
Bernie Sanders, the united nations is telling us that in the years to come theyre going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world what we have got to do tonight and i will do as president is to tell the fossil fuel industry that theyre shortterm profits on not more important than the future of this planet and by the way the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that they are carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator sanders andrea,7
Andrea Mitchell, president trump has dramatically changed americas approach to our adversaries by holding summits with kim jongun getting out of the iran nuclear deal and at times embracing vladimir putin and other strong men so lets talk about what kind of commander in chief you would be,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator harris north korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits if president trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons if you were commander in chief would you make concessions to kim jongun in order to keep those talks going,7
Kamala Harris, with all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate donald trump got punked he has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander in chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland and to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military but that when we walk in any room around the globe we are respected because we keep to our word we are consistent we speak truth and we are loyal,7
Kamala Harris, what donald trump has done from pulling out of the paris agreement to pulling out of the iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times including most recently the kurds points out that donald trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment,7
Andrea Mitchell, but would you make concessions to north korea,7
Kamala Harris, not at this point there are no concessions to be made he has traded a photo op for nothing he has abandoned by shutting down the operations with south korea for the last year and a half so those operations which should be and those exercises which should be active because they are in our best national security,7
Kamala Harris, the relationship that we have with japan he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on north koreas nuclear program,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator mr vice president president trump inherited the north korea problem from past presidents so were in decades what would a president biden do that president obama didnt do in eight years,7
Joe Biden, first of all i would go back and making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president he has absolutely ostracized us from south korea he has given north korea everything they want to create in the legitimacy by having a meeting with kim jongun whos a thug although he points out that im a rabid dog needed to be beaten with a stick very recently it was a comment,7
Bernie Sanders, other than that you like him,7
Joe Biden, other than that i like him and not in japan and australia and being a pacific power and putting pressure on china in order for them to make sure that it is a non it is a nuclearfree peninsula and the way we do that is we make clear to china which i have done personally with the president of china and that is were going to move up our defenses we are going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with south korea and if they view that as a threat its an easy thing to respond to they in fact can in fact put pressure on,7
Joe Biden,  to respond to they can in fact put pressure on north korea but the fact is that were in a position where he has done this across the world hes embraced thugs look what putin is doing in europe putin is his whole effort is to break up nato to increase his power look what hes done to it this guy has no idea what hes doing he has no notion how to go about it and we need a commander in chief for what he stands everybody knows what he or she,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you mr vice president two more us soldiers were killed today in afghanistan tragically in americas longest war senator sanders youve long said you want to bring the troops back home from afghanistan would you cut a deal with the taliban to end the war even if it means the collapse of the afghan government that america has long supported,7
Bernie Sanders, well let me just say this one of the big differences between the vice president and myself is he supported the terrible war in iraq and i helped lead the opposition against it and not only that i voted against the very first gulf war as well and i think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are that we dont have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined but to answer your question yeah i think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region it is time to bring our troops home,7
Bernie Sanders, but unlike trump i will not do it through a tweet at three oclock in the morning i will do it working with the international community and if its necessary to negotiate with the taliban of course we will do that but at the end of the day we have to rethink the entire war on terror which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives not only for our own men and women in the armed forces but for people in that region as well,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator ashley,7
Ashley Parker, thank you mr yang if you win the 2020 election what would you say in your first call with russian president vladimir putin,7
Andrew Yang, well first id say im sorry i beat your guy,7
Senator Warren, its a sorry youre not sorry,7
Andrew Yang, well not sorry and second i would say the days of meddling in american elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression the american people would back me on this we know that theyve found an underbelly and theyve been clawing at it and its made so that we cant even trust our own democracy the third thing i would say is that were going to live up to our international commitments were going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including nato and it was james mattis that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy the less you have to spend on ammunition,7
Andrew Yang, that has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus not just against russia but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on china in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and whats going on in hong kong i want to propose a new world data organization like a wto for data because right now unfortunately were living in a world where data is the new oil and we dont have our arms around it these are the ways that well actually get russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order,7
Ashley Parker, thank you mr yang rachel,7
Rachel Maddow, on the issue of china senator booker china is now using force against demonstrators in hong kong where millions have taken to the streets advocating for democratic reforms many of the demonstrators are asking the united states for help if you were president would the us help their movement and how,7
Senator Booker, well first of all this is a president who seems to want to go up against china in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact attacking them as well we use a national security waiver to put tariffs on canada at the very time that china is breaking international rules is practicing unfair practices stealing technology forcing technology transfer and violating human rights this nation is pulling away from critical allies we would need to show strength against china theres a larger battle going on on the planet earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies and we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good with china actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government with its leader now getting rid of term limits,7
Senator Booker, i believe we need a much stronger policy one thats not led as president trump seems to want to do in a transactional way but one thats led by american values yes we will call china out for human rights violations but not only that we will stop engaging in things that violate american rights because it is a human rights violation when people at our border children are thrown in cages its a human rights violations without coming to the united states congress for an authorization to the use of military force for us to refuel saudi jets to bomb yemeni children it is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy or what we are going to lead with and begin to check china check putin and the other folks who are trying to undermine american values and democratic values around the globe,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator andrea,7
Andrea Mitchell, mr vice president the cia has concluded that the leader of saudi arabia directed the murder of usbased journalist jamal khashoggi the state department also says the saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture president trump has not punished senior saudi leaders would you,7
Joe Biden, yes and i said it at the time khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and i believe in the order of the crown prince and i would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them we were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are theres very little social redeeming value in the present government in saudi arabia and i would also as pointed out i would end subsidies that we have end the sale of material to the saudis well theyre going in and murdering children and theyre murdering innocent people and so they have to be held accountable,7
Joe Biden, and with regard to china we should look unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights we should be going to the united nations seeking condemnation of china what theyre doing with a million uighurs that are essentially in concentration camps in the west we should be vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to hong kong we have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator klobuchar,7
Amy Klobuchar, yes,7
Andrea Mitchell, just to follow up would you go against the saudis even though that would potentially help around their adversaries,7
Amy Klobuchar, we need a new foreign policy in this country and that means renewing our relationships with our allies it means rejoining international agreement and it means reasserting our american values when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an american newspaper that sent a signal to all dictators across the world that that was okay and thats wrong,7
Amy Klobuchar, and i want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said first of all the question about russia when we look at international agreements we must start negotiating back with russia which has been a horrible player on the international scene but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with russia and we must start negotiating even though they were cheating for the good of this world and we must also start the negotiations for the new start treaty and when it comes to china we need someone that sees the longterm like i do just like the chinese do because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet and they are in it for the long game,7
Andrea Mitchell, senator sanders,7
Bernie Sanders, i think i may have been the first person up here to make it clear that saudi arabia not only murdered khashoggi but this is a brutal dictatorship which gets every taken can to crush democracy treats women as third class citizens and when we rethink our american foreign policy what we have got to know is that saudi arabia is not a reliable ally we have got to bring iran and saudi arabia together in a room under american leadership and say we are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts,7
Bernie Sanders, and by the way the same thing goes with israel and the palestinians it is no longer good enough for us to simply to be proisrael i am proisrael but we must treat the palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve what is going on in gaza right now where youth unemployment is 70 or 80 is unsustainable we need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world work with united nations and not continue to support brutal dictatorships,7
Andrea Mitchell, thank you senator rachel,7
Rachel Maddow, senator warren only about 1 of americans serve in the united states military right now should that number be higher,7
Senator Warren, yes i think it should be all three of my brothers served in the military one was career military the other two also served i think its an important part of who we are as americans and i think the notion of shared service is important its how we help bring our nation together its how people learn to work together from different regions people who grew up differently its also about how families share that sacrifice i remember what it was like when i was a little girl my brother my oldest brother who served five and a half years off and on in combat in vietnam and what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox had we heard from don reed hows he doing,7
Senator Warren, and if there was a letter she was brighter than the day and if it wasnt shed say well maybe tomorrow this is about building for our entire nation and i believe we should do that i also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country for example what i want to do is for our federal lands i want to bring in 10000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change,7
Rachel Maddow, senator warren,7
Senator Warren, we can do this as a nation,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator in president trumps first two years in office the pentagon budget ballooned mayor buttigieg would you cut military spending or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory,7
Pete Buttigieg, we need to reprioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular its not just how much although we certainly need to look at the runaway in military spending its also where right now we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that china is doing right now if we fall behind on artificial intelligence the most expensive ships that the united states is building just turn into bigger targets we do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president after all hes relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall there is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future,7
Senator Booker, can i respond to buttigieg,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you,7
Senator Warren, can i respond on this,7
Rachel Maddow, coming up we will have much more from the candidates were going to take a quick break just a moment stay with us,7
Kristen Welker, welcome back everyone to the fifth democratic debate lets move now to the issue of race in america fbi director christopher wray recently told congress the majority of the domestic terrorism cases that weve investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence congresswoman gabbard to you as president would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing,7
Tulsi Gabbard, yes i would we have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry divisiveness and attacks that have unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow americans leadership starts at the top its important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty this is something that ill do as president and commanderinchief is to overhaul our criminal justice system working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs and the money bail system,7
Tulsi Gabbard, and thats the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past the most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect all of us as fellow americans regardless of race religion ethnicity gender orientation and our politics that kind of leadership starts at the top as president i will usher in a 21st century white house that actually represents the interests of all americans first and foremost,7
Kristen Welker, congresswoman gabbard thank you for that mr yang what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence,7
Andrew Yang, well first we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the department of justice can properly measure it i talked to an anti hate activist named christian picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period he said he was a lonely 14yearold and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade now hes out and hes helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society but what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt broken 14yearold boy he would have gone with them,7
Andrew Yang, he said if it had been a coach i would have gone with him if it had been a mentor teacher i would have gone with them but instead it was a hate group what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks and when you look at gun violence in this country 96 plus percent of the shooters were talking about are young boys and young men we have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy strong young men who do not hate but instead feel like they have paths forward in todays economy,7
Kristen Welker, mr yang thank you for that vice president biden the me too movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in america are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem,7
Joe Biden, yes and by the way its one of the reasons the first thing i would do is make sure we pass the violence against women act reauthorization which i wrote the fact i didnt write the reauthorization i wrote the original act the fact is that what happens now is that we in fact have to fundamentally change the culture the culture of how women are treated thats why as vice president when i asked the president if i could start the movement on the college campuses to say its on us its everyones responsibility,7
Joe Biden, we do not spend nearly enough time dealing with i was stunned when i did a virtual town meeting that told me 30000 people were on the call young people between 15 and 25 and found out i said what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and your schools you know what they said get men involved engage the rest of the community and thats why we started this movement on the college campus is to fundamentally change the culture,7
Joe Biden, no man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in selfdefense and that rarely ever occurs we have to just change the culture period and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it it will be a big punch no i really mean it its a gigantic issue and we have to make it clear from the top from the president on down that we will not tolerate it we will not tolerate this culture,7
Kristen Welker, mr vice president thank you senator harris this week you criticize mayor pete buttigiegs outreach to african american voters you said the democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are as the diversity of the american people what exactly prompted you to say that senator harris,7
Kamala Harris, well i dont know that was a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published but listen i think that it really speaks to a larger issue and ill speak to the larger issue i believe that the mayor has made apologies for that the larger issue is that for too long i think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the democratic party and have overlooked those constituencies they show up when its close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote but just havent been there before,7
Kamala Harris, i mean there are plenty of people who applauded black women and for the success of the 2018 election applauded black women for the election of a senator from alabama but at some point folks get tired of just saying oh thank me for showing up and say well show up for me because when black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in america when the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death when black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar the question has to be where you been and what are you going to do and do you understand who the people are,7
Kamala Harris, and im running for president because i believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks and weve got to recreate the obama coalition to win and that means about women thats people of color thats our lgbtq community thats working people thats our labor unions but that is how we are going to win this election and i intend to win,7
Kristen Welker, senator harris thank you mayor buttigieg your response to that,7
Pete Buttigieg, my response is i completely agree and i welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in america who dont yet know me and before i share whats in my plans let me talk about whats in my heart and why this is so important as mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income for eight years i have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but then compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory i care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how i make myself useful to those who have been excluded marginalized and cast aside and oppressed in society,7
Pete Buttigieg, and i care about this because while i do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin i do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side shoulder to shoulder making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldnt have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience,7
Kristen Welker, may buttigieg thank you very much senator harris quick response,7
Kamala Harris, look there is a lot at stake in this election and ive said it many times i think justice is on the ballot in 2020 and its about economic justice its about justice for children its about justice for our teachers i could go on down the list the issue really is not what is the fight the issue has to be how are we going to win and to win we have to build a coalition and rebuild the obama coalition i keep referring to that because thats the last time we won,7
Kamala Harris, and the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together and everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and therefore ability to bring folks together around our commonalities of which i believe there are many,7
Kristen Welker, thank you senator senator warren quickly,7
Senator Warren, i think it is really important that we actually talk about what were willing to get in the fight for and i just want to give one example around this senator harris rightly raised the question of economic justice let me give a specific example and that is student loan debt right now african americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college borrow more money while theyre in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out today in america a new study came out 20 years out whites borrowed money 94 of them have paid off their student loan debt 5 of african americans had paid it off i believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness it will help close the blackwhite wealth gap lets do something tangible and real to make change in this country,7
Kristen Welker, senator warren thank you ashley,7
Ashley Parker, senator warren back to you youve said that the border wall that president trump has proposed is a monument to hate and division would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nations southern border,7
Senator Warren, if there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense of course we should do it the real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in central america he has withdrawn aid that means that families have to flee for their lives have to flee for any economic opportunity you know what i found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families,7
Senator Warren, i went down to the border i went down there and immediately i was in mcallen texas and i just hope everyone remembers what this looks like there was like a giant amazon warehouse filled with cages of women cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys i spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me shed given a drink to a police officer and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police she knew what that meant she wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border we need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect a great nation does not separate children from their families we need to live our values at the border every single day,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator senator booker a quick response,7
Senator Booker, look i want to be quick on this because id like to get back to something that i wasnt included in is,7
Senator Warren, so would we all,7
Senator Booker, absolutely if this is not effective we see people cutting holes in this wall his wall the way he brags about it its just wrong we need to have policies that respect dignity keep us safe and strong i wanted to return back to this issue of black voters i have a lifetime of experience with black voters ive been one since i was 18 nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from african american voters black voters are pissed off and theyre worried theyre pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote,7
Senator Booker, and theyre worried because the democratic party we dont want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isnt trusted doesnt have authentic connection thats whats on the ballot and issues do matter i have a lot of respect for the vice president he has sworn me into my office as a hero this week i hear him literally say that i dont think we should legalize marijuana i thought you mightve been high when you said it,7
Senator Booker, and let me tell you because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people and its what the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people and let me say this theres more african americans under criminal supervision in america than all the slaves since 1850 do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children,7
Senator Booker, because there are people in congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana while there are people our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community and if we dont have somebody authentically we lost the last election let me just give you this data example,7
Ashley Parker, quickly quickly,7
Senator Booker, we lost in wisconsin because of a massive dimunition a lot of reasons but there was a massive dimunition in the african american vote we need to have someone that can inspire as kamala said to inspire african americans to the polls in record numbers,7
Ashley Parker, thank you senator booker vice president biden you can respond to that,7
Joe Biden, ill be very brief number one i think we should decriminalize marijuana period and i think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail their records expunged and be completely zeroed out but i do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the longterm effects for the use of marijuana thats all it is number one everybody gets out record expunged,7
Joe Biden, secondly im part of that obama coalition i come out of the black community in terms of my support if you notice i have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced from me because they know me they know who i am three former chairs of the black caucus the only black african american woman that ever been elected to the united states senate a whole range of people my point is,7
Kamala Harris, thats not true,7
Senator Booker, thats not true not true,7
Joe Biden, i said the first african american woman my point is one of the reasons i was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship longstanding relationship with the black community i was part of that coalition,7
Ashley Parker, thank you kristen,7
Kristen Welker, and we do have to take another quick break but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in atlanta georgia stay with us,7
Rachel Maddow, welcome back to the msnbcwashington post democratic candidates debate many states including right here where we are tonight in georgia have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion right now roe versus wade protects a womans right to abortion nationwide but if roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back senator klobuchar,7
Amy Klobuchar, well of course we should codify roe v wade into law that is what we should do this president indicated early on what he was going to do and hes done it when he was running for office he literally said women should go to jail then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail no surprise that were seeing these kinds of laws in georgia and alabama where his allies are passing these bills what we have to remember is that the people are with us i predict this will be a big election in issue in the general election i just cant wait to stand across from donald trump and say this to him you know what the people are with us over 70 of the people support roe v wade over 90 of the people support funding for planned parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need he is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of america this is how were going to win this election,7
Rachel Maddow, just this weekend louisiana reelected a democratic governor john bel edwards he has signed one of the countrys toughest laws restricting abortion is there room in the democratic party for someone like him someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights senator warren,7
Senator Warren, look i believe that abortion rights are human rights i believe that they are also economic rights protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a democratic party understand this when someone makes abortion illegal in america rich women will still get abortions its just going to fall hard on poor women its going to fall hard on girls women who dont even know that theyre pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle i want to be an america where everybody has a chance i know it can be a hard decision for people but heres the thing when it comes down to that decision a woman should be able to call on her mother she should be able to call on her partner she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government,7
Rachel Maddow, senator warren i need to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question governor john bel edwards in louisiana is an antiabortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in louisiana is there room for him in the democratic party with those politics,7
Senator Warren, i have made clear what i think the democratic party stands for im not here to try to drive anyone out of this party im not here to try to build fences but i am here to say this is what i will fight for as president of the united states the women of america can count on me,7
Rachel Maddow, senator warren thank you senator sanders ill give you 30 seconds,7
Bernie Sanders,  mentioned that women feel troubling on it well let me just tell you that if theres ever a time in american history where the men of this country must stand with the women this is the moment i get very tired very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say get the government off our backs we want small government well if you want to get the government out of the backs of the american people then understand that it is women who control their own bodies not politicians,7
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders thank you,7
Senator Booker, this is a voting issue,7
Rachel Maddow, senator booker,7
Senator Booker, this is a voting issue this is a voter suppression issue right here in this great state of georgia it was the voter suppression particularly of african american communities that prevented us from having a governor stacey abrams right now that is when you have undemocratic needs when you suppress peoples votes to get elected those are the very people youre going to come after when youre in office this bill opposed by over 70 the heartbeat bill here opposed by over 70 of georgians is the result from voter suppression this gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day that whoever is the nominee they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes particularly of low income and minority voters and particularly in the black community like we saw here in georgia,7
Rachel Maddow, senator senator booker thank you to that point individual states as you all know set their own rules for voting and for elections depending on where you live you may be required to show id or not you might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none you might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town with that in mind our next question comes from jenna in maryland who asks what will you do at the executive level to ensure that every american has equal access to the ballot box mayor buttigieg,7
Pete Buttigieg, well we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century because this affects every other issue that we care about now the house of representatives passed a pro democracy anticorruption bill which is one of many good bills to die in mitch mcconnells hands in the united states senate we know that with the white house in the right hands we can make for example election days a federal holiday we can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration same day voter registration making it easier for people to vote and in particular recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins,7
Pete Buttigieg, right now we have politicians picking out their voters rather than the other way around that compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name,7
Amy Klobuchar, i just i want to  this,7
Pete Buttigieg, while these process issues are not always fashionable we must act to reform our democracy itself including when it comes to choosing our presidency what we do in  election giving it to the person who got the most votes,7
Rachel Maddow, senator klobuchar,7
Amy Klobuchar, i want to point out,7
Pete Buttigieg, election giving it to the person who got the most votes,7
Rachel Maddow, forgive me mr mayor,7
Amy Klobuchar, i agree with what the mayor has just said but this is a good example where he has said the right words but i actually have the experience and in leading 11 of the bills that are in that house passed bill you just referred to i think this kind of experience matters i have been devoted to this from the time that ive got to the senate i think having that experience knowing how you can get things done leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say yeah you have to say where these ads come from and how theyre paid for and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that dont have backup paper ballots that is my bipartisan bill and i am so close to getting it done the way i get it done is if im president just like i have won statewide and mayor i have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried i also have actually done this work i think experience should matter,7
Rachel Maddow, mayor buttigieg ill let you respond to that,7
Pete Buttigieg, first of all washington experience is not the only experience that matters theres more than a hundred years of washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country i have the experience of bringing people together to get something done i have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an american president i have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives our homes our families our workplaces and our marriages i would submit that this is the kind of experience we need not just to go to washington but to change it before it is too late,7
Rachel Maddow, mr mayor thank you,7
Tulsi Gabbard, i need to jump in here thank you,7
Rachel Maddow,  on the original question of voting rights please,7
Tulsi Gabbard, i mean voting rights are essential for our democracy securing our elections is essential for our democracy ive introduced legislation called the securing americas elections act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voters voice is heard but i want to get back to pete buttigieg and his comment about experience pete youll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander in chief i think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president be willing to send our troops to mexico to fight the cartels,7
Tulsi Gabbard, as commander in chief leader of our armed forces i bring extensive experience serving for seven years in congress on the foreign affairs committee on the armed services committee on the homeland security committee meeting with leaders of countries around the world working with military commanders of different commands,7
Rachel Maddow, congresswoman,7
Tulsi Gabbard, dealing with high level national security briefings understanding whats necessary the preparation that ive gotten to walk in on day one to serve as commander in chief,7
Rachel Maddow, congresswoman thank you mr mayor ill allow you to respond,7
Pete Buttigieg, i know that its par for the course in washington to take remarks out of context but that is outlandish even by the standards of todays politics,7
Tulsi Gabbard, are you saying that you didnt say that,7
Pete Buttigieg, i was talking about us mexico cooperation weve been doing security cooperation with mexico for years with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading mexico,7
Tulsi Gabbard, thats not what i said thats not what i said thats not what i said,7
Pete Buttigieg, im talking about building up alliances if your question is about experience lets also talk about judgment one of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was bashar alassad i have in my experience such as it is whether you think it counts or not since it wasnt accumulated in washington enough judgment that i would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that,7
Rachel Maddow, congresswoman gabbard let me allow you to respond,7
Tulsi Gabbard, thank you you were asked directly whether you would send our troops to mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes the fact checkers can check this out but your point about judgment is absolutely correct our commander in chief does need to have good judgment and what youve just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation i take the example of those leaders who have come before us leaders like jfk who met with khrushchev like roosevelt who met with stalin,7
Pete Buttigieg, like donald trump who met with kim,7
Tulsi Gabbard, like reagan who met and worked with gorbachev these issues of national security are incredibly important i will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harms way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security ill bring real leadership and experience to the white house,7
Rachel Maddow, congresswoman ,7
Pete Buttigieg, ,7
Rachel Maddow, senator sanders im going to have you respond,7
Bernie Sanders,  right to the point the american people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt and it is not just voter suppression which cost the democratic party a governorship here in this state not just denying black people and people of color the right to vote but we also have a system through citizens united which allows a billionaires to buy elections what we need to do simple and straight forward in every state in this country through the federal government if you are 18 you have a right to vote end of discussion we have to overturn citizens united we need to move toward public funding of elections,7
Rachel Maddow, on this last point mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, well i agree with exactly what bernie said but i want to talk about how were going to win in 2020 i dont mean to change the subject but i think its sort of important that the democratic party not only beat donald trump in 2020 but have a sweeping victory across the country what thats going to mean is turnout in the united states of america the democratic party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are republicans to like us when up to half the people dont vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth no one deals with my issues the system is broken why would we vote but what weve found at nextgen america is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important if you look at 2018 and flipping the house what really happened was democratic voting went up by three quarters in the 38 congressional districts where nextgen america was turning out young people the turnout went up by more than a hundred percent more than double,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, for us to win for everybody on this stage for whoevers the candidate to have a senate thats democratic for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely are going to have next year,7
Rachel Maddow, mr steyer thank you,7
Tom Steyer, its a turnout question were going to have to tell the truth,7
Rachel Maddow, sir,7
Tom Steyer, and were going to have to organize across this country,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you very much it is time at this point it is well past time if im honest to start closing statements we are going to start tonight with senator booker the floor is yours,7
Senator Booker, thank you rachel its an honor to be here tonight i have not yet qualified for the december stage i need your help to do that if you believe in my voice and that i should be up here please go to corybookercom please help i had a closing statement prepared but i saw in the audience during the break a man named john lewis perhaps its interesting and important for me to mention why im so grateful to him ive been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change not just beat donald trump thats the floor we need to go to the ceiling we need to go to the mountaintop i am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life changed his mind to get up and start representing families one of them mine who are discriminated against the house i grew up in is because of that lawyers activity,7
Senator Booker, when i asked him why why he did what he did he told me that on march 7th 1965 he was watching a movie called judgment at nuremberg on tv they interrupted that movie to show a bridge in alabama called the edmund pettus bridge there he saw john lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by alabama state troopers we all owe a debt that we cannot repay we all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig this is the moment in america where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again that we have truly a moral moment in america like it was back in 1965 if you give me a chance to lead i will cause what john lewis says is good trouble i will challenge us i will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator,7
Senator Booker, because we need to mobilize a new american movement keep me on this stage keep me on this race it is time we fight and fight together please go to corybookercom,7
Rachel Maddow, senator booker thank you very much,7
Speaker 1, mr steyer your closing statement,7
Tom Steyer, i started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the white house i stand by that statement but im different from everybody else on this stage i know that the government in washington dc is broken i know that its been purchased by corporations and ive spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary american citizens to beat those corporations im the only one on this stage whos willing to talk about structural change in washington itself term limits that if were going to make bold changes were going to need new and different people in charge im the only person on this stage whos spent decades building an international business,7
Tom Steyer, whoever of us is the democratic nominee is going to have to face mr trump or the republican and talk about the economy talk about growth understand that we can make mr trump what he is a fraud and a failure on the economy which is his strong point im the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority that its our biggest challenge but its our biggest opportunity to recreate this country if you want to beat mr trump if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants im the person who can do it,7
Speaker 1, thank you mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, i have spent a decade trusting the american people,7
Speaker 1, thank you mr steyer,7
Tom Steyer, im asking you to trust me,7
Speaker 1, thank you,7
Speaker 2, congresswoman gabbard go ahead,7
Tulsi Gabbard, my personal commitment to you to all of my fellow americans is to treat you with respect and compassion something that we in hawaii call aloha every single person deserves to be treated with respect regardless of race religion or gender or even your politics inclusion unity respect aloha these will be the operating principles for my administration now dr martin luther king visited hawaii first back in 1959 where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the aloha spirit he said we look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country he later went on to say as i looked out at the various faces in various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea i see only one face the face of the future working side by side lets defeat the divisiveness of donald trump come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony of racial justice peace inclusion and true equality working side by side lets make dr kings dream a reality,7

Speaker 3, mr yang your turn,7
Andrew Yang, im here with my wife evelyn tonight we have two young boys christopher and damian how many of you all are parents like us here in the room if youre a parent youve had this thought maybe youve been afraid to express it and it is this our kids are not all right theyre not all right because were leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents we are going through the greatest economic transformation in our countrys history the fourth industrial revolution and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side we talk as if donald trump is a cause of all of our problems he is not he is a symptom and we need to cure the disease,7
Andrew Yang, now my first move was not to run for president of the united states because i am not insane my first move was to go to dc talk to our leaders and say technology is ripping us apart immigrants are being scapegoated our kids are being left behind and the american dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes the people in washington dc had nothing for this they dont want to touch it they dont want to talk about an issue they dont think they have a solution for im not running for president because i fantasized about being president,7
Andrew Yang, im running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight im a parent and a patriot and i have seen the future that were leaving for our kids it is not something im willing to accept we need to create a new way forward for our people if you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy go to yang2020com and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them and believe it your country loves you your country values you and you will be all right,7
Speaker 3, thank you mr yang,7
Rachel Maddow, senator klobuchar,7
Amy Klobuchar, the nation was riveted this week by the testimony in washington one of the people we heard from yesterday was lieutenant colonel vindman what he said was this he spoke to his immigrant father and he said in this country you can tell the truth and its going to be fine it reminded me of a army council years and years ago in the mccarthy hearing someone from iowa actually mr welch who said have you no sense of decency sir i want us to remember that this election is yes an economic check on this president i have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare yes this is also a patriotism check a value check a decency check when you look at the people that turned out in kentucky and turned out in virginia people turned out that didnt vote in 2016 the african americans are turning out like we didnt see before but we also and they must be with us and we must get our fired up democratic base with us,7
Amy Klobuchar, we also lets get those independents and moderate republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore this is how we build the coalition we dont just beat donald trump we bring the us senate to some sense we send mitch mcconnell packing this is how we win if you want to join us and remember that this wont be for me a personal victory itll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time if you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesnt end on election day but begins on inauguration day join us amyklobucharcom thank you,7

Speaker 1, senator harris,7
Kamala Harris, were in a fight this is a fight for our rule of law for our democracy and for our system of justice and its a fight we need to win to fight this fight i believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with donald trump i have taken on jeff  i have taken on bill barr i have taken on brett kavanaugh i know i have the ability to do that we also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that ive done that work i believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race their gender their party affiliation where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks,7
Kamala Harris, my entire career has been spent having one client and one client only the people i have never represented a corporation i have never represented a special interest in this election justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender are very much on the ballot from economic justice to reproductive justice to health care justice to educational justice i truly believe that when we overcome these injustices we will then unlock the potential of the american people and the promise of america thats the america i believe in thats the america i see that is why im running for president,7
Speaker 1, thank you senator harris,7
Speaker 3, mayor buttigieg go ahead,7
Pete Buttigieg, well first of all i want to remark that were in the city of atlanta a city where a great local leader maynard jackson helped create the black middle class that atlanta is known by by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded just as local leaders have shown great leadership we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country im not only running to defeat donald trump i am running to prepare for the day that begins when donald trump has left office to launch the era that must come after trump,7
Pete Buttigieg, that era must be characterized not by exclusion but by belonging and so must our campaign i am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues weve been talking about tonight all along moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition and a lot of future former republicans who i know are watching this disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country i want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that were building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create i hope you go to peteforamericacom join this effort and help us create a better era for the american people beginning in november 2020,7

Senator Warren, thank you i listened to this debate tonight and i hear a lot of really good ideas but i take a look at the issues weve talked about weve talked about climate change weve talked about defense spending weve talked about private health insurance we should have talked about gun violence what do these issues have in common well first they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives what is the second thing they have in common we know what we need to do we have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of americans are with us on it and yet we dont make change why not because of corruption because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription it works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms instead of into our public schools,7
Senator Warren, we have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else i have the biggest anti corruption plan since watergate it involves ending lobbying as we know it blocking the revolving door between industry and washington making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online we have to have the courage not to make just individual changes not to fight for little pieces we want to make real progress on climate then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country,7
Senator Warren, i am so grateful to be here and i am grateful to an america that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher a chance to become a college professor a chance to become a united states senator,7
Rachel Maddow, thank you senator,7
Senator Warren, and a chance to become a candidate for president of the united states thank you,7
Speaker 1,  vice president biden your closing statement,7
Joe Biden, i assume when were talking about the corruption of the federal government we werent talking about barack obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress one thing we havent talked about here today weve talked about everything we havent talked about the one thing i think is most consequential the american people have an enormous opportunity theres incredible  ive never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career and i got elected as a 29 year old kid to the united states senate folks we are in a position where were the wealthiest nation in the world our workers are more productive than the workers around the world three times as productive as workers in asia,7
Joe Biden, we have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined were in a position where weve led not by the example of our power but by the power of our example im so tired of everybody walking around like woe is me what are we going to do lets remember this is the united states of america there has never ever ever been a time when we set our mind to do something weve been able to do it never never never its time to remember who we are get up lets take back this country and lead the world again its within our power to do it get up and take it back,7
Rachel Maddow, vice president biden thank you let me take this opportunity to thank all of the candidates for a spirited and excellent debate well i want to thank all of you and i want to tell you that on msnbc tonight my colleague brian williams is going to pick up our coverage in just a moment i also before we go i want to thank everybody here in the audience i want to thank the city of atlanta from all of us here at the dais thank you so much for watching good night,7
Judy Woodruff, welcome back a quick reminder of the rules for this debate  each candidate has one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions from the moderators and 45 seconds to answer rebuttal and followup questions tonights podium order on the stage was determined by an average of recent polls and lets begin,8
Judy Woodruff, to the candidates last night at this hour the house of representatives voted for only the third time in american history to impeach a president every one of you was in favor of this action but unlike 1974 and president nixon congressional democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of americans to support impeachment of president trump why do you think that is and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks to persuade more americans that this is the right thing to do i want to ask all of you to respond but to begin with vice president biden,8
Joe Biden, you know judy it was a constitutional necessity for the house to act as it did and trumps response to suggest that only half of the american people want to see him thrown out of office now i find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what i even thought he would do is any wonder that if you look at the international polling thats been done that the chinese leader is rated above american the american president or that vladimir putin congratulated him saying stand fast and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him we need to restore the integrity of the presidency of the office of the presidency and its about time we get that underway my job and i think the job of all of us up here is to in fact well thats not true some are going to be actually voting in the senate but my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesnt deserve to be president of united states for another four years,8
Judy Woodruff, senator sanders why do you think more people are not in support of impeachment and what else can you do,8
Bernie Sanders, well judy what i would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar we have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country and we have a president who is a fraud because during his campaign he told working people one thing and he ended up doing something else i believe and i will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country who wants to cut social security medicare and medicaid after he promised he would not do that and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president and the case to be made is yeah certainly i disagree with trump on virtually all of his policies but what conservatives i think understand is that we cannot have a president with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the united states,8
Judy Woodruff, senator warren why do you think why do you think more americans dont agree that this is the right thing to do and what more can you say,8
E. Warren, so i see this as a constitutional moment last night the president was impeached and everyone now in the senate whos taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution and that doesnt mean loyalty to an individual it doesnt mean loyalty to a political party it means loyalty to our country and that vote will play out over the next several weeks but the way i see this is weve now seen the impact of corruption and thats whats clearly on the stage in 2020 is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history this president has made corruption originally his argument that he would drain the swamp and yet he came to washington broke that promise and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the wellconnected from tax breaks to ambassadorships we have to prosecute the case against him and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the trump administration and a democrat who is willing to get out and fight not for the wealthy and wellconnected but to fight for everyone else thats why im in this race,8
Judy Woodruff, senator klobuchar senator klobuchar what argument can you make to persuade more americans this is the right thing,8
Amy Klobuchar, let me make the case to the american people as a wise judge said the president is not king in america the law is king and what james madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention and by the way i think hes a pretty good size for a president he was five foot four and what he said he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution that the provisions are in there is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the american people for a foreign power that is what happened here watergate this is a global watergate in the case of watergate a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent he did it by getting people to break in this president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent,8
Amy Klobuchar, and i would make this case as we face his trial in the senate if the president claims that he is so innocent then why doesnt he have all the presidents men testify richard nixon had his top people testify we should be hearing from mulvaney who is the one under oath witnesses have said that mulvaney is the one that said okay were going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent we should hear from bolden who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president that is the case if president trump thinks that he should not be impeached he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses,8
Judy Woodruff, mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg what additional argument can you make to the american people,8
Pete Buttigieg, at the end of the day this is beyond public opinion this is beyond polls this is beyond politics the president left the house with no choice and i think a lot of us are watching this process watching washington go through the motions and not expecting much but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the senate we cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because thats what they want they want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether meanwhile their allies are laughing all the way to the bank,8
Pete Buttigieg, as we see policies that let giant corporations some of which made billions in profits pay not just zero but as weve recently learned negative taxes all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working americans heres the good news  its up to us no matter what happens in the senate it is up to us in 2020 this is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness to refuse and reject the cynicism that is what this presidential election is about it is what my campaign is about our opportunity in 2020 no matter what happens in washington as a country to change the course of this nation for the better,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang what more,8
Tom Steyer, im over here,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang what more can you say to the american people,8
Tom Steyer, judy judy sorry,8
Judy Woodruff, im sorry mr steyer im sorry,8
Tom Steyer, well let me remind everyone that im the person who started the need to impeach movement over two years ago because i believe what counts here is actually the american peoples opinion over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in american history its not a question of political expediency its not a question of political tactics its a question of right and wrong so now when we look whats going on i actually agree with senator klobuchar the question here is if we want the american people to understand whats going on we need to have the administration officials testify on tv so we can judge,8
Tom Steyer, the court that counts here is the court of public opinion the american people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath so we can make up our mind if we want republican senators to do the right thing we need their constituents to see the truth on tv and tell them get rid of this guy or well get rid of you thats what i believe in im a believer in the grassroots as an outsider getting the american peoples voice to count thats who i trust and thats who i trust now,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang,8
Andrew Yang, its clear why americans cant agree on impeachment were getting our news from different sources and its making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts congressional approval rating last i checked it was something like 17 percent and americans dont trust the media networks to tell them the truth the media networks didnt do us any favors by missing a reason why donald trump became our president in the first place if you turn on cable network news today you would think hes our president because of some combination of russia racism facebook hillary clinton and emails all mixed together,8
Andrew Yang, but americans around the country no different we blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in ohio michigan pennsylvania wisconsin missouri i just left iowa we blasted 40000 manufacturing jobs there the more we act like donald trump is the cause of all of our problems the more americans lose trust that we can actually see whats going on in our communities and solve those problems what we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment which unfortunately strikes many americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got donald trump elected in the first place we have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country a new way forward to help beat him in 2020 because make no mistake hell be there at the ballot box for us to defeat,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you mr yang lets turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all americans and that is the economy senator sanders today the house of representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the united states canada and mexico it was supported by unionfriendly leaders like speaker nancy pelosi and big labor groups like the aflcio they say it is going to be a big job creator senator my question is will you support this deal and if not why not,8
Bernie Sanders, judy youre talking to somebody who unlike some of my colleagues here voted against nafta voted against pnc  with china two agreements that cost us over four million decentpaying jobs now i dont agree with the your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator this is a modest improvement over what we have right now it would allow hopefully mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions and be able to negotiate decent contracts but at the end of the day in my view it is not going to stop outsourcing it is not going to stop corporations from moving to mexico where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour what we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers stands up for farmers and by the way the word climate change to the best of my knowledge is not discussed in this new nafta agreement at all which is an outrage so no i will not be voting for this agreement although it makes some modest improvements,8
Judy Woodruff, senator klobuchar,8
Amy Klobuchar, i have a different view ill go with my friend sherrod brown who has voted against every trade agreement thats come in front of him and hes voting for this and i am too and the reason i am voting for it is that i believe that we have a change with this agreement i would not have voted for the agreement that president trump put forward but weve got better labor standards better environmental standards and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision which i also oppose,8
Amy Klobuchar, 95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair because if we can encourage work made in america every time you hold something in your hand that says made in america it is the ingenuity of our workers it is equality of a product it is equality of our workers and it is the hopes and dreams of the american people i think this agreement while senator sanders is correct there are some issues with it is much better than the one originally proposed and for those farmers in the midwest and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with mexico and with canada and the united states i think that this is a much better deal,8
Judy Woodruff, all right we can pull some of your i see some other hands up i want to move to the next question and you can bring in i think your points with this but this one im going to initially address to vice president biden and that is the overall us economy right now looks strong the unemployment rate is at historic lows unemployment among african americans is down the markets are booming wages while not growing as much as many would like theyre still doing about as well as they were in the obamabiden era my question to you mr vice president is what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight who may not like everything president trump does but they really like this economy and they dont know why they should make a change,8
Joe Biden, well i dont think they really do like the economy go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in the middle class is getting killed the middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that you have for example farmers in the midwest 40 percent of them could pay couldnt pay their bills last year you have most americans if theyve received the bill for 400 dollars or more theyd have to sell something or borrow the money,8
Joe Biden, the middle class is not is behind the eight ball we have to make sure that they have an even shot we have to eliminate significant number of these godawful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy we have to invest in education we have to invest in healthcare we have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living thats not being done and the idea that were growing were not growing the wealthy very wealthy are growing ordinary people are not growing they are not happy with where they are and thats why we must change this presidency now,8
Judy Woodruff, mayor buttigieg is that your is that your assessment,8
Andrew Yang, yes where i live folks arent measuring the economy by how the dow jones is looking theyre measuring the economy by how theyre doing when youre doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table and you find that even if your wages have gone up is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health and hows this economy is not working for most of us for the middle class and i know youre only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics but weve got to talk about poverty in this country,8
Andrew Yang, there is not one county in the united states of america where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment in most places not even a one bedroom apartment the biggest problem in our economy is simple  people are not getting paid enough that is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force its the result of bad policy and weve got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang mr yang,8
Andrew Yang, gdp and corporate profits are at record highs in america today also at record highs depression financial insecurity student loan debt even suicides and drug overdoses it has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in american history the fact is this unemployment rate and gdp have very little relationship with peoples lived experience on the ground if youre a recent college graduate you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesnt require a college degree that doesnt show up in the headline unemployment rate nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by,8
Judy Woodruff, senator warren you have your hand up,8
E. Warren, i do,8
Judy Woodruff, and i have a question for you,8
E. Warren, well i want to ask,8
Judy Woodruff, go ahead,8
E. Warren, this question,8
Judy Woodruff, go ahead,8
E. Warren, because heres the problem im proud to stand on a stage with democrats who understand that a rising gdp rising corporate profits is not being felt by millions of families across this country im proud to stand on a stage with people who see that americas middle class is being hollowed out and that working families and poor people are being left behind,8
E. Warren, what we need to talk about though is why that has happened and the answer is weve got a government that works great for those with money and doesnt work for much of anyone else we have a government that works great for giant drug companies just not for someone trying to fill a prescription works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border just not for the people whose lives are torn apart works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere but not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us and when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the wellconnected and for no one else that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out for what it is,8
Judy Woodruff, i want i want senator sanders if you would a brief response and then i have another question,8
Bernie Sanders, look heres the response trump goes around saying the economy is doing great do you know what real inflation accounted for wages went up last year one point one percent that aint great tonight while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of america 500000 americans including 30000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets today in america we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s we need an economy that works for working families not just the 1 percent that is what our campaign is about,8
Judy Woodruff, senator warren i have a question for you every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy but you have especially ambitious plans that apart from healthcare would hike taxes an additional eight trillion dollars over the decade the biggest tax increase since world war ii how do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment,8
E. Warren, oh theyre just wrong lets start with a wealth tax the idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country 50 million dollars and above for two cents what can we do we can invest in the rest of america we can provide universal childcare early childhood education for every baby in this country age zero to five universal prek for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage,8
E. Warren,  pre k for every threeyearold and fouryearold and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher we can do even more for our public schools for college graduates we can cancel student loan debt but think about the economic impact of that you leave two cents with the billionaires theyre not eating more pizzas theyre not buying more cars we invest that 2 in early childhood education and childcare that means those babies get top notch care it means their mamas can finish their education it means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs harder jobs longer hours we can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up thats how we built it in small towns thats how we built it in rural america and thats how we built it in urban america an economy that works,8
Judy Woodruff, brief answers,8
E. Warren, not from wall street but that works for main stram,8
Judy Woodruff, brief responses from mr steyer and mr buttigieg,8
Tom Steyer, let me say that i agree with senator warren in much of what she says ive been for a wealth tax for over a year im in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations  that this administration has put through and in addition ive talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income which would allow us to cut taxes for 95 of americans by 10 but theres something else going on here that i think is really important and thats this we know mr trumps going to run on the economy,8
Tom Steyer, i built a business over 30 years from scratch were going to have to take him on on the economy in terms of growth as well as economic justice were going to have to be able to talk about growth prosperity across the board for everyone in america my experience building a business understanding how to make that happen means i can go toe to toe with mr trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure and i think thats different from the other people on this stage i think we need a different unconventional way of attacking a different unconventional president who actually went after the,8
Judy Woodruff, mayor,8
Tom Steyer, best prepared candidate in american history and beat her,8
Judy Woodruff, mayor buttigieg,8
Pete Buttigieg, right now i think were being offered a false choice you either have to go all the way to the extreme or its business as usual yes we must deliver big ideas and yes taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up we can also be smart about the promises were making make sure theyre promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy its why for example i propose that we make college free for 80 of americans but it doesnt have to be free for the top if youre in that top 10 how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on that would make a big difference whether its infrastructure childcare housing health on issue after issue weve got to break out of the washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow americans it can antagonize,8
Judy Woodruff, were going to take a short break and well be right back in two minutes with questions from my fellow moderators,8
Speaker 1,  welcome back everyone we are here back at the break in this debate the first of three breaks this is a short one im joined by of course our fantastic panel of analysts and journalists and i want to first ask you stephanie sy and amy walter we hit the two big topics right off the top impeachment basically president trump how do you deal with him and the economy lets start with the economy thats the number one issue for voters here all of these candidates want 15 an hour minimum wage at least eventually but what differences did we hear anything significant,8
Amy Walter, the difference we heard was at the very end there with pete buttigieg saying we got to make sure that they are promises that we can keep and going back something we talked about before the debate began this sense of breaking away from elizabeth warren by saying we can be big we can be bold we can have really progressive ideas but if we look like we are measuring our boldness just in how much tax we are putting on americans how big the programs are going to be thats just going to come back and hurt the democratic nominee,8
Speaker 1, stephanie sy,8
Stephanie Sy, so first of all elizabeth warrens answer to judys question she didnt answer it directly she just said no those models are wrong there are different economic models of what impact,8
Speaker 1, what about the economic data that  she said theyre just wrong,8
Stephanie Sy, yeah and you know the fact is wharton at the university of pennsylvania came out with a budget model just last week and did say that her model in the next 10 years could constrain gdp growth so there are different models out there shes going to have to continue to explain that question if she makes it into the general election,8
Speaker 1,  and she has to also have some details,8
Stephanie Sy, thats all right,8
Speaker 1, it looks like candidates mightve gotten their drinks of water i hope you did too and were going to go back to the stage momentarily again for the pbs newshour politico democratic debate many more big issues to come stay tuned,8
Speaker 1, ,8
Speaker 2, live from angeles the pbs newshour politico democratic debate continues once again judy woodruff,8
Judy Woodruff, welcome back to the pbs newshour politico democratic presidential debate the next question is from tim alberta of politico,8
Tim Alberta, thanks judy candidates good evening were going to talk about climate now senator klobuchar many scientists say that even if the us reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done the climate change will have made certain places in the us unlivable so knowing this would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of american families and businesses away from places like miami or paradise california perhaps davenport iowa because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again,8
Amy Klobuchar, well i very much hope were not going to have to relocate entire cities but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents and the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in california with the fires that you just had you saw it in northern california as was mentioned with paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down,8
Amy Klobuchar, we cannot wait to act theres an ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions not for this generation but seven generations from now this president doesnt keep his decisions for seven minutes so what i think we need to do get back into the international climate change agreement i will do that on day one on day two bring back the clean power rules on day three the gas mileage standards i see the governor of california who has been working so hard to get those done defied every step of the way by the trump administration and then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator klobuchar mr steyer would you support such a new federal program again to help subsidize the relocation of these families,8
Tom Steyer, look i am hoping that we in fact will do what im suggesting which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency i believe im the only person here who will say unequivocally this is my number one priority i know that we have to deal with this crisis i know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice ive been working on this for more than a decade ive taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws ive pushed clean energy across this country ive prevented pipelines and ive prevented fossil fuel plants,8
Tom Steyer, but i know is this not only can we clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated this is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middleclass union jobs wellpaid across the united states of america our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we dont declare a state of emergency on day one i dont understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only america can lead look this is a generational question i have a lot of respect for the people on this stage i know everybody is worried about this but for instance i would call on mayor buttigieg to prioritize this higher because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now but its also the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent america,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr steyer mr buttigieg 45 seconds to respond,8
Pete Buttigieg, well ive made clear that this will be a topic of day one action and this is not theoretical for me i live in one of those river cities that youre talking about not only that i live right by the river my neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years do the math on that so i know whats at stake and its why i insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy energy storage and carbon storage but bigger than that you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this,8
Pete Buttigieg, ive seen politicians in washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as ive been alive all these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050 and i think most or all of us have one their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done,8
Tim Alberta, wed like to switch,8
Pete Buttigieg, and that is why i want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in south bend to a farmer a few minutes away so that they understand that we are asking recruiting them to be part of the solution,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr mayor,8
Pete Buttigieg, not beating them over the head and telling them they are part of the problem,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr mayor wed like to switch gears slightly vice president biden id like to ask you three consecutive american presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production as president would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy,8
Joe Biden, the answers yes the answers yes because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs as tom said is real were the only country in the worlds ever taken great great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities ive met with the union leaders for example we should in fact making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained that it doesnt leak energy that in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where theres all kinds of folks out here right here in california were now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining we have enormous opportunities for example you talk about would we relocate people who in fact were in a position where they lost their home,8
Joe Biden, we have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people we have to rebuild the standard that exists today for example we shouldnt build another new highway in america that doesnt have charging stations on it we have an opportunity to put 550000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market theres so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities,8
Tim Alberta, thank you vice president biden senator sanders,8
Bernie Sanders, tim in all due respect your question misses the mark it is not an issue of relocating people in towns the issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren the issue as you should know what the scientists are telling us is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change youre talking about the paris agreement thats fine aint enough we have got to and ive introduced legislation to do this declare a national emergency the united states has got to lead the world and maybe just maybe instead of spending 18 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction maybe an american president ie bernie sanders can lead the world instead of spending money to kill each other maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator sanders senator warren a new question to you senator warren many of our western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because its efficient affordable and virtually carbon free and many climate experts believe that its impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050 without utilizing nuclear energy so can you have it both ways on this issue,8
E. Warren, so i see right now is weve got to get the carbon weve got to stop putting more carbon into the air weve got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place i will not build more nuclear i want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science what we put into research and development we need to do what we do best and that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader but understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in washington who keeps saying the right thing but continue to take money from the oil industry continue to bow down to the lobbyist to the lawyers to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts,8
E. Warren, america understands that weve got to make change and were running out of time that climate change threatens every living thing on this planet but getting congress to act they just dont want to hear it and if we dont attack the corruption first if we dont attack the corruption head on then were not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate on gun safety on drug pricing on all of the big problems that face us we need a washington that doesnt just work for the rich and the powerful we need one that works for our families,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator senator klobuchar and then id like to bring in senator yang and mr steyer with the follow ups,8
Amy Klobuchar, i wanted to add to what elizabeth said so the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes talking about whats happening on the coast is i just did but also talking about whats happening in the midwest where im from its not fly over country to me i live there and what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding were seeing an increase 50 increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills when you make the case like that you bring in the midwestern votes you win big and i think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket whos from the midwest,8
Tim Alberta, mr yang 45 seconds on the issue of nuclear energy,8
Andrew Yang, well first we should obviously be paying to relocate americans away from places that are hit by climate change were already doing it we relocated a town in louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose and we know that town is not alone thats playing out in coastal areas around the country the question is do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say we need to protect our people from climate change part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground because thats what we need to do and thats literal and figurative here in california its forest fires and forest management and nuclear power i agree with the research we need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation which this is,8
Andrew Yang, other countries have had success with nuclear power and the next generation thoriam reactors have a wealth of potential thoriam is not radioactive the way uranium is it doesnt last as long and you cant make a weapon out of it whereas if were going to innovate our way out of this as elizabeth is saying then we have to have nuclear on the table,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr yang the last one on the climate to you mr steyer,8
Tom Steyer, the point about nuclear power is its not at the stage in the united states where its competitive on price it has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years we actually have the technology that we need its called wind and solar and batteries so in fact what we need to do we can do weve got to stop taking a look at this as something that we cant do because we can do this and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis creates millions of union jobs and we come at it from the standpoint of environmental justice this is our greatest opportunity to reinvent this country to actually take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together you want to pull the country together with all this partisanship lets take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together as a nation thats what pulls people together,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr steyer amna,8
Amna, thanks tim vice president biden,8
Joe Biden, yes,8
Amna, youve been reassuring voters that things will return to normal once president trump leaves office that republicans will have what you call an epiphany and come to the table to work with the biden administration but given everything that you have seen from current republicans what evidence is there that things will change,8
Joe Biden, look i didnt say return to normal normal is not enough in fact we would have to move beyond normal whether its healthcare or the environment whatever it is we have to build on what we had started in our administration and thats been interrupted very badly number one number two with trump out of the way its not going to change things in a fundamental way but what it will do is it will mean that were in a position where his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen republicans we may need in other things,8
Joe Biden, i refuse to accept the notion as some on the stage do that we can never never get to a place where we have cooperation again if thats the case where dead as a country we need to be able to reach consensus and if anyone has reason to be angry with the republicans and not want to cooperate its me the way theyve attacked me and my son and my family i have no love but the fact is we have to be able to get things done and when we cant convince them we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states,8
Amna, thank you mr biden mr gang i want to switch topics to you mr yang a new question the democratic party relies on black hispanic and asian voters but you are the only candidate of color on the stage tonight and the entire field remains overwhelmingly white what message do you think this sends to voters of color,8
Andrew Yang, its both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight,8
Andrew Yang, honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight i miss kamala i miss cory though i think cory will be back i grew up the son of immigrants and i had many racial epithets used against me as a kid but black and latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words they have numbers the average net worth of a black household is only 10 that of a white household for latinos its 12 if youre a black woman youre 320 more likely to die from complications in childbirth these are the numbers that define race in our country and the question is why am i the lone candidate of color on this stage fewer than 5 of americans donate to political campaigns you know what you need to donate to political campaigns disposable income,8
Andrew Yang, the way we fix it the way we fix this is we take martin luther kings message of a guaranteed minimum income a freedom dividend of 1000 a month for all americans i guarantee if we had a freedom dividend of 1000 a month i would not be the only candidate of color on this stage tonight,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr yang senator sanders i do want to put the same question to you senator sanders what message do you think,8
Bernie Sanders, i will answer that question but i wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because i do believe this is the existential issue,8
Amna Nawaz, senator with all respect this question is about race can you answer the question as it was asked,8
Bernie Sanders, i certainly can because people of color in fact are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change and by the way we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our african american brothers and sisters up here to speak about an economy in which african americans are exploited where black women die three times at higher rates than white women where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken disproportionately made up of african americans and latinos and native americans who are in jail so we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed exploited people and that is the african american community,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you senator yamiche,8
Yamiche, thank you amna senator klobuchar here in california people who identify as hispanic black asian or multiracial represent a majority of the population outnumbering white residents the united states is expected to be majority nonwhite within a generation what do you say to white americans who are uncomfortable with the idea of becoming a racial minority even if you dont share their concerns,8
Amy Klobuchar, id say this is america youre looking at it and we are not going to be able to succeed in the world if we do not invite everyone to be part of our economy our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union well thats what we are in doing right now and to me that means one that everyone can vote and that includes our communities of color this action thats been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong they have made it harder for african americans to vote as one court said discriminated with surgical precision,8
Amy Klobuchar, what would i do as one of the leaders on voting in the us senate one stop the purging as stacey abrams said you do not stop having your right to assemble if you dont go to a meeting for a year because you dont go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months you dont lose your right to worship you shouldnt lose your right to vote i would pass as president my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote that would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and i would stop the gerrymandering in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity because as martin luther king says what good is it to integrate a lunch counter if you cant afford a hamburger,8
Yamiche, thank you senator lets now turn to the issue of foreign policy and the middle east senator sanders secretary of state mike pompeo recently declared that the united states believes israeli settlements in the west bank do not violate international law that broke decades long us precedent how would you respond to israeli expansion of settlements would you link that to foreign aid to israel,8
Bernie Sanders, israel has and i say this is somebody who lived in israel as a kid proudly jewish israel has the right not only to exist but to exist in peace and security but what us foreign policy must be about is not just being proisrael we must be pro palestinian as well and whether in my view we must understand that right now in israel we have leadership under netanyahu who has recently as you know been indicted for bribery who in my view is a racist what we need is a level playing field in terms of the middle east which addresses the terrible crisis in gaza where 60 or 70 of the young people are unemployed so what my foreign policy will be about is human rights is democracy is bringing people together in a peaceful way trying to negotiate agreements not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses,8
Yamiche, thank you senator mayor buttigieg,8
Pete Buttigieg, what we are seeing in the middle east and around the world are the consequences of this presidents failure this presidents refusal to lead its particularly disturbing in the case of israel because he has infused domestic politics making us foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in israeli domestic politics acting as though that somehow makes him pro israel and pro jewish while welcoming white nationalists into the white house,8
Pete Buttigieg, but its not only in the middle east that we see the consequences of the disappearance of us leadership we see among our allies and among our adversaries case after case where the world is making plans on what to do ignoring the united states because were no longer considered reliable its not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference its the looks on the faces of the leaders at the un as they looked at the united states president with a mixture of contempt and pity,8
Pete Buttigieg, as an american i never again want to see the american president looked at that way by the leaders of the world the world needs america right now but it cant be just any american it has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are supporting peace supporting democracy supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world,8
Yamiche, thank you mayor buttigieg senator warren president obama pledged to close the detention camp at guantanamo bay but could not 40 prisoners remain there last year us taxpayers paid 540 million to keep guantanamo open would you pledge to finally close the detention facility and if elected how will you do it,8
E. Warren, yes its time to close this detention facility it not only costs us money it is an international embarrassment we have to be an america that lives our values every single day we cant be an america that stands up and asks people to fight alongside us as we did with the kurds in fighting isis and then turn around in the blink of a tweet and say that were turning our backs on the people who stood beside us after that who wants to be an ally of the united states we have to be an america that understands the difference and recognizes the difference between our allies the people who will work alongside us and the dictators who would do us harm and we need to treat our allies better than we treat the dictators that needs to be our job as an america,8
E. Warren, we have the finest military on earth all three of my brothers served and we have people on this stage who have served and im deeply grateful for that our military is strong and important but we need to be an america that relies on our state department that relies on diplomacy that relies on our economic power and that relies on working together with the rest of the world to build a world that is sustainable environmentally and economically for everyone,8
Yamiche, thank you senator warren vice president biden why couldnt you close guantanamo bay why couldnt the obama administration close guantanamo bay,8
Joe Biden, we attempted to close guantanamo bay but you have to have congressional authority to do it theyve kept it open and the fact is that we in fact think its the greatest it is an advertisement for creating terror look what we have done around the world in terms of keeping guantanamo open or what trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in israel there is no solution for israel other than a two state solution it does not exist its not possible to have a jewish state in middle east without there being a two state solution and he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in israel,8
Joe Biden, bibi netanyahu and i know one another well he knows that i think what hes doing is outrageous what we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the israelis to move to a two state solution not withdraw a physical aid from them in terms of their security and lastly i think that,8
Yamiche, thank you vice president biden,8
Joe Biden, senator warren is correct we have led by not the example of our power but the power of our example and the example were demonstrating now is horrible its hurting us badly,8
Yamiche, thank you vice president biden judy,8
Judy Woodruff, i want to turn to another part of the world and thats china mayor buttigieg you have said that you think china presents more of a challenge than do your fellow candidates believe the us clearly wants chinas cooperation on human rights on climate change on north korea on terrorism and yet americans are appalled by chinas record on human rights including the detention of over a million muslim uyghurs should the us is my question do more than protest and issue sanctions should the us for example boycott the 2022 beijing olympics,8
Pete Buttigieg, i think that any tool ought to be on the table especially diplomatic economic and social tools like what youre describing look for the president to let it be known that his silence whether its on the rounding up of muslim uyghurs in xinjiang putting them into camps or the aspirations of the people of hong kong for democracy for him to let china know that his silence can be purchased is trashing american values the reality is that theres a lot more to the relationship with china than whos selling more dishwashers yes we need a much smarter trade policy,8
Pete Buttigieg, we also have to acknowledge whats going on over there the use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship that is going to require a stronger than ever response from the us in defense of democracy but when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the president of the united states what message is that sending to the chinese communist party the message i will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like tienanmen square when it comes to hong kong they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically,8
Judy Woodruff, mr steyer many americans have been moved in the last months by the protests of the people of hong kong it is chinese territory but what could you would you do as president if the chinese government moved in militarily,8
Tom Steyer, look there is a temptation particularly for this president to try and answer that in a bilateral way the way the united states should be reacting in hong kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy and freedom loving partners and allies to push back in fact when were making moral statements around the world it should not be us threatening and trying to be the worlds policemen it should be us leading on a value driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world,8
Tom Steyer, we actually cant isolate ourselves from china in fact we have to work with them as a frienemy people who disturb us who we disagree with but who in effect we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer and in fact if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is we are going to have to partner with the chinese they are going to have to come along with us theyre going to have to trust us and together were going to have to solve this problem so the ability to say,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you mr steyer,8
Tom Steyer, its off the table we need a good relationship with them were going to have to work with them going forward under all circumstances,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you mr steyer vice president biden on china we now know that china is engaged in an unprecedented military buildup they have just launched a new aircraft carrier there are new signs of their disturbing espionage campaign here inside the united states there are a number of disturbing signs from the chinese national security scholars have long warned about the historical precedent that when theres a ruling power and a rising power theres likely to be a war is the us on a collision course with china what steps could you take as president,8
E. Warren, its on a collision course with china but not for war what we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what theyve done 1 million uyghurs as you pointed out muslims are in concentration camps thats where they are right now theyre being abused theyre in concentration camps and what we started in our administration that trump stopped we should be moving 60 of our seat power to that area of the world to let in fact the chinese understand that theyre not going to go any further we are going to be there to protect other folks,8
E. Warren, secondly we in fact should make sure that we began to rebuild our alliances which trump has demolished with japan and south korea australia and indonesia we in fact need to have allies who understand that were going to stop the chinese from their actions we should be gone to the un immediately and sought sanctions against them and the united nations for what they did we have to be firm we dont have to go to war but we have to make it clear this is as far as you go china and in terms of their military buildup its real but it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are were not looking for a war but weve got to make clear we are pacific power and we are not going to back away,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang and then senator klobuchar,8
Andrew Yang, i have family in hong kong i spent four months there and seeing whats happening on the streets its shocking they banned face masks in hong kong why because they have ai technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later this is the rivalry that we have to win where chinas concerned theyre in the process of leapfrogging us in ai because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars,8
Andrew Yang, i have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the chinese resources china just produced its first major smartphone that does not have google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world what we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win,8
Judy Woodruff, senator klobuchar,8
Amy Klobuchar, when it comes to foreign policy i think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats and this president has done neither and a country like china theyre leaders they watch that and they know he has stood with dictators over innocents he has stood with tyrants over free leaders he does it all the time and i have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with nato yeah they were making fun of him some of the foreign leaders ive heard senators make more fun of other senators than that the point of it was that he couldnt even tolerate it he is so thin skinned that he walked he quit america doesnt quit,8
Amy Klobuchar, so if we want to send a message to the chinese we stand with our allies we stand with them firmly we have a very clear and coherent foreign policy when it comes to human rights check out my website amyklobucharcom i have the five rs of our foreign policy about reasserting our values rejoining international agreements like the iranian nuclear agreement but it all comes down to one r returning to sanity,8
Judy Woodruff, mayor buttigieg and then were going to take a break,8
Pete Buttigieg, im actually not worried about the presidents bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of im worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world when the american president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people democracy around the world gets weaker freedom of the press not just here at home but around the world gets weaker its one more reminder of what is at stake not just here at home but for world history in the imperative that we win this election,8
Amy Klobuchar, could i respond,8
Pete Buttigieg, this is our chance,8
Judy Woodruff, very brief very brief,8
Amy Klobuchar, okay i just want to make very clear mayor that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart my dad was a newspaper man and i am the one that asked every attorney general candidate weve had under donald trump both of whom i opposed about their respect for the first amendment and they have refused to follow the rules that attorney general holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists they would not commit that they wouldnt put a journalist in jail for doing their job so this is not just talking points to me this is the real world and i think that experience that i will bring to the white house with protecting the first amendment is worth more than any talking points,8
Judy Woodruff, were going to take a short break and we will be,8
Judy Woodruff, politico democratic presidential debate im judy woodruff joined by my pbs newshour colleagues amna nawaz and yamiche alcindor by tim alberta of politico now lets turn to the next question from tim,8
Tim Alberta, thank you judy candidates lets make things interesting former president obama said this week when asked who should be running countries that if women were in charge youd see a significant improvement on just about everything he also said quote if you look at the world and look at the problems its usually old people usually old men not getting out of the way,8
Tim Alberta, senator sanders you are the oldest candidate on stage,8
Bernie Sanders, and im white as well,8
Tim Alberta, yes how do you respond to what the former president has said,8
Bernie Sanders, well i got a lot of respect for barack obama i think i disagree with him on this one maybe a little selfserving but i do disagree here is the issue the issue is where power resides in america and its not white or black or male or female we are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians you have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare for all people which is why we need medicare for all we are facing an existential crisis of climate change the issue is not old or young male or female the issue is working people standing up taking on the billionaire class and creating a government and an economy that works for all not just the 1,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator sanders vice president biden im going to guess that president obama did not clear that remark through your campaign ahead of time what do you say to it,8
Joe Biden, im going to guess he wasnt talking about me either,8
Tim Alberta, okay,8
Joe Biden, look im running because ive been around all my experience with experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom the fact is that were in a position now the next president of the united states is going to inherit two things economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be used where we have to unite america and a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able on day one stand up look out the entire world know who that person is know what they stand for and know they know them and thats the reason im running i have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage,8
Tim Alberta, just to follow up vice president biden if elected you would turn 82 at the end of your first term youd be the oldest president in american history,8
Joe Biden,  churchill,8
Tim Alberta, are you willing to commit  american history,8
Joe Biden, oh american history,8
Tim Alberta, yes,8
Joe Biden, i was joking it was a joke,8
Tim Alberta, okay i appreciate it,8
Joe Biden, politico doesnt have much of a sense of humor,8
Tim Alberta, oh weve got a great sense of humor they wouldnt have put me on stage otherwise,8
Tim Alberta, are you willing to commit tonight to running for a second term if youre elected next november,8
Joe Biden, no im not willing to commit one way or another heres the deal im not even elected one term yet and lets see where we are,8
Joe Biden, but its a nice thought,8
Tim Alberta, senator klobuchar you had your hand raised,8
Amy Klobuchar, thank you for asking a woman this question first of all we have not had enough women in our government when i was on trevor noahs show once i explained how in the history of the senate there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad they would shut it down however it is not just about numbers its about what you get done and that is my argument if you look at the poll at the state that knows me best and that is the state of minnesota it showed in the state that hillary had her lowest margin of victory it showed that i beat donald trump by 18 points i beat him with men more than anyone on this stage so i think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas particularly in the midwest and number two what will you do when you get there,8
Amy Klobuchar, and i am someone that has passed over 100 bills with men and women with republicans and with democrats including changing the sexual harassment laws for the united states congress a bill i led so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people i have passed the law for drug shortages i have done work in our rural areas i think thats what most matters to people i would be so proud to be the first woman president but mostly i want to be a president that gets things done and improves peoples lives,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator klobuchar,8
Tim Alberta, senator warren you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated id like you to weigh in as well,8
E. Warren, id also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated i believe that president obama was talking about who has power in america whose voices get heard i believe hes talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out and for me the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020 i made the decision when i decided to run not to do business as usual and now im crowding in on 100000 selfies thats 100000 hugs and handshakes and stories stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt stories from people who cant pay their medical bills stories from people who cant find childcare now most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken in order to have a conversation and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator warren,8
E. Warren, no i want to finish this those selfies cost nobody anything and i get it in a democracy we all have a lot of different points of view and everybody gets one vote but heres the thing people who can put down 5000 to have a picture taken dont have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or struggling to pay off medical debt im running a campaign where people whose voices get heard we cant have people who can put down 5000 for a check drown out the voices of everyone else they dont in my campaign and they wont in my white house,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator warren mayor buttigieg you had your hand raised,8
Pete Buttigieg, i cant help but feel that mightve been directed at me and heres the thing were in the fight of our lives right now donald trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing not even foreign interference to hold on to power theyve already put together more than 300 million this is our chance this is our only chance to defeat donald trump and we shouldnt try to do it with one hand tied behind our back the way were going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight if that means that youre a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamericacom and chip in 10 bucks thats great and if you can drop 1000 without blinking thats great too we need everybodys help in this fight im not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat donald trump we need democrats whove been with us all along yes but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country if you were republican disgusted with whats going on in your own party were not going to agree on everything but we need you in this fight and i will welcome you to our side,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr mayor senator warren 45 seconds to respond,8
E. Warren, so the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served 900 a bottle wine think about who comes to that he had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door but this one was closed door we made the decision many years ago that rich people in smokefilled rooms would not pick the next president of the united states billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the united states,8
Tim Alberta, mr mayor your response,8
Pete Buttigieg, you know according to forbes magazine i am literally the only person on this stage whos not a millionaire or a billionaire this is important this is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass if i pledge never to be in the company of a progressive democratic donor i couldnt be up here senator your net worth is 100 times mine now supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit i know this isnt likely but stay with me and decided to go on to pete for americacom and give the maximum allowable by law 2800 would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person no i would be glad to have that support we need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat donald trump,8
Tim Alberta, we would like to bring another one but obviously senator warren id like to give you a chance to respond,8
E. Warren, i do not sell access to my time i dont do calltime with millionaires and billionaires,8
Pete Buttigieg, hold on a sec sorry as it went senator,8
E. Warren, i dont meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors and look ive taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here ive said to anyone who wants to donate to me if you want to donate to me thats fine but dont come around later expecting to be named ambassador because thats what goes on in these high dollar fundraisers i said no and i asked everybody on this stage to join me this ought to be an easy step and heres the problem if you cant stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy cant stand up to the wealthy and wellconnected when its relatively easy when youre a candidate then how can the american people believe youre going to stand up to the wealthy and wellconnected when youre president and its really hard,8
Pete Buttigieg, senator ive got to respond to this,8
Tim Alberta, mr mayor were going to give you one more chance to respond,8
Pete Buttigieg, first of all if you cant say no to a donor then you have no business running for office in the first place but also senator your presidential campaign right now as we speak is funded in part by money you transferred having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce did it corrupt you senator of course not so to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president obama went by that speaker pelosi goes by that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us,8
Tim Alberta, wed like to bring everyone in wed like to bring everyone in,8
E. Warren, he addressed me directly,8
Amy Klobuchar, i did not come here to listen to this argument i came here to make a case for progress and i have never even been to a wine cave ive been to the wind cave in south dakota which i suggest you go to so what is making a case for progress about that is what unites us up here instead of what divides us which is campaign finance reform that means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united it means making the first bill we pass when i am president will be hr1 which is the ethics reform passed in the house which is currently sitting on mitch mcconnells desk along with 400 bills and if you dont think we can get this done well we can but only if we win this election big not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done i came to make a case for progress,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator klobuchar senator sanders,8
Bernie Sanders, i am rather proud maybe i dont know the only candidate up here doesnt have any billionaire contributions but you know what i do have we have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the united states of america at this point in an election averaging 18 a piece now theres a real competition going on up here my good friend joe and he is a good friend hes received contributions from 44 billionaires pete on the other hand is trailing pete you only got 39 billionaires contributing so pete we look forward to you i know youre an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on joe on that issue but what is not a laughing matter my friends this is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half this is why amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes we need to get money out of politics we should run our campaigns on that basis,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator sanders vice president biden 45 seconds to respond,8
Joe Biden, my average contribution is 43 number one thats number one number two the idea that the senators suggesting that im in the pocket of billionaires when in fact they oppose everything that ive ever done and continue to do i have made sure from the very beginning every one of my fundraisers is open to the press every single solitary one not one single time period and ive made sure that you know exactly where all the  and the largest contribution ive accepted is 2800 which is allowed under the law and im the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is now all public funding of elections end all private funding and we all should make a commitment of that right now on this stage in the meantime you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign average contribution 43,8
Tim Alberta, thank you vice president  i would like to bring you in,8
Bernie Sanders, can i,8
Tom Steyer, listen im running because this government is broken because its purchased by corporations and ive spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people thats what ive been doing for a decade but let me say this theres someone whos loving this conversation and his name is donald trump,8
Bernie Sanders, thats right,8
Tom Steyer, we know how hes going to run hes told us last week he looked at a group of americans and said i dont like you you dont like me it doesnt matter youre going to support me because the democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes we need to go after this guy hes a different breed of cat and we need to beat him and we need to talk about prosperity and i spent 25 years building a business were going to have to take him on the economy not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down but actually go after this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks hes king and where in fact hes a fraud and a failure,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr steyer were going to end it there amna,8
Amna Nawaz, i want to turn now to an issue thats been in the headlines quite a bit and that is immigration mr yang we have a question here from a professor right here at loyola marymount there are nearly 200000 daca recipients socalled dreamers in the state of california more than any other state including several students right here at lmu if you win and you reinstate daca through executive action another president could just overturn it again so will you move on a permanent legislative fix for dreamers in your first 100 days if elected,8
Andrew Yang, of course i would im the son of immigrants myself and i know that dreamers are essentially americans in everything but this legal classification i just want to return to this conversation because i think its core our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that money and men are tied together thats where i thought elizabeth was taking the conversation the fact is strong societies would elect more female leaders strong men treat women well for the same reasons im on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while we kind of become morons,8
Andrew Yang, so its related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally antiwoman marketplace and that includes the marketplace for politicians if we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every american voter instead of 5 contributing youd see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60 and youd have many many more women who would run for office because they dont have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr yang id like to follow up the question again mr yang,8
Amy Klobuchar, can i address immigration reform,8
Amna Nawaz, was about dreamers you pledge to move on a permanent legislative fix in your first 100 days dreamers say that they are frustrated by democrats failure to prioritize their status in deal after deal so why should dreamers trust democrats now,8
Andrew Yang, i believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by dreamers in the first hundred days i would make it a top priority im the son of immigrants myself the fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic and immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with if you go to the factory in michigan its not wall to wall immigrants its wall to wall robot arms and machines we have to send the opposite message of this administration and as your a president i think i could send a very clear message where if youre considering immigrating to this country and im the president you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the united states thats the opposite of the current administration and thats the message i would love to send to the world,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr yang senator sanders i have a new question for you you can respond to mr yangs comments as well,8
Bernie Sanders, i cant respond to the immigration question,8
Amna Nawaz, this is related sir but there are estimated to be as many as 12 million undocumented immigrants in the us more than 2 million right here in california if you have a chance to forge a bipartisan immigration reform plan would you insist on a path to citizenship for all 12 million or just a segment of that population,8
Bernie Sanders, no this is what i would do day one executive order restore the legal status of 18 million young people in the daca program day one we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers day one day one we introduce bipartisan legislation which will in fact be comprehensive which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented that is what the people of our country want trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up we are going to win this election by bringing our people together black and white and latino native american asian american thats what this campaign is about thats what america must be about,8
Amna Nawaz, senator klobuchar,8
Amy Klobuchar, thank you i started my day today with a group of immigrants who are there talking to me about housing and i thought about this president and what hes done he has used our immigrants as political pawns every single day he tries to draw a wedge i will be a different president my view on this comes from experience when i got to the senate senator kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package we got so close to passing that i voted for it not everyone did but most of the democrats did then i was on the judiciary committee when president obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform we actually passed that with republican votes then i was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the dreamers that would have solved that problem we didnt get that done because this president gutpunched us,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you senator,8
Amy Klobuchar, i will take my views i will take this experience i will get this done because immigrants dont diminish america they are america,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you senator mr steyer briefly your response,8
Tom Steyer, listen i think its important to note that this president is not against immigration hes against immigration by nonwhite people,8
Amy Klobuchar, yes,8
Tom Steyer, this is his attempt to divide us as senator sanders said on race and thats what hes been doing since the very first day he started running for president hes been vilifying nonwhite people hes been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country that theyre going to lose control of their lives and as somebody who lives in a majorityminority state which is california what hes doing is so wrong on so many different levels i agree with senator sanders we have to reframe this argument completely we have to go back to the idea that every american is worth being a full human being on every right this is a racial argument by a racist president whos trying to divide us and whos vilifying people its absolutely wrong and its led him to break the laws of humanity in our name,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr steyer mayor buttigieg a new question to you mr mayor you said last month that the us owes compensation to children separated from their families at the southern border the consensus among child welfare experts is that those thousands of children will likely suffer lifelong trauma as a result of that separation are you committing as president to financial compensation for those thousands of children,8
Pete Buttigieg, yes and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the united states did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken and on the larger issue of immigration my understanding of this issue isnt theoretical its not something i formed in committee rooms in washington it begins with the fact that my household my family came from abroad my father immigrated to this country and became a us citizen it comes from the fact that im the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life largely because of the contributions mainly of latino immigrants,8
Pete Buttigieg, largely because of the contributions mainly of latino immigrants and ive seen those same neighborhoods shut down families huddling in church panicking just because of the rumor of an ice raid that does not make our country safe,8
Amy Klobuchar, could i respond,8
Pete Buttigieg, just to look into the eyes of an eight year old boy whose father was deported even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name and try to think of something to tell that boy because i couldnt tell him what he most wanted to hear which is just that he was going to have his dad back how can harming that young man possibly make america safer,8
Amna Nawaz, mr mayor just,8
Pete Buttigieg, when i am president based on those experiences i will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values and that means not only ending these unspeakable frugal practices at the border but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed a full overhaul since the 1980s,8
Amna Nawaz, mr mayor,8
Pete Buttigieg, we cannot wait four years 10 years we cannot wait anymore to do something about this,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr mayor just to followup since you do support compensation for those families should the us also compensate descendants of enslaved people do you support reparations for african americans,8
Pete Buttigieg, i support hr 40 which is the bill that has been proposed in congress to establish a commission to look at reparations but we shouldnt wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative remember were not talking about a gift to anybody were talking about mending what was broken were talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of african americans and just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time so does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the united states must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity with investments in hbcus and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken,8
Amna Nawaz, vice president biden do you support reparations,8
Joe Biden, not any since i havent spoken on this got a chance number one the reason were the country we are is because of immigration weve been able to cherrypick the best from every single continent the people that come here have determination resilience they are ready to stand up and work like the devil we had a 24 out of every 100 children in our school today is hispanic the idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but as bad for america they are the future of america and we should invest in them everybody will be benefit from it every single american and you should get used to it this is a nation of immigrants thats who we are thats why we are who we are thats what makes us different and we should invest in them,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr biden senator klobuchar sorry you had your hand up,8
Amy Klobuchar, i was hearkening back i made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about washington so i look at this a different way when we were in the last debate mayor you basically mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage and what do i see on this stage i see elizabeths work starting the consumer financial protection bureau and helping 29 million people i see the vice presidents work in getting a 2 billion for his cancer moonshot i see senator sanders work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and i see what ive done which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills so what you can dismiss committee hearings i think this experience works and i have not denigrated your experience as a local official i have been one,8
Pete Buttigieg, you know sorry,8
Amy Klobuchar, i just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you senator mr mayor ill give you a chance to respond,8
Pete Buttigieg, you actually did denigrate my experience senator and it was before the break and i was going to let it go cause we got bigger fish to fry here but you implied that my relation,8
Amy Klobuchar, oh i dont think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the united states,8
Pete Buttigieg, youre right and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the first amendment was a talking point as if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here let me tell you about my relationship to the first amendment it is part of the constitution that i raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life that is my experience and it may not be the same as yours but it counts senator it counts,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you mr mayor senator klobuchar this time you have 45 seconds to respond,8
Amy Klobuchar, i certainly respect your military experience thats not what this is about this is about choosing a president and i know my view of this is i know you ran for to be chair of the democratic national committee thats not something that i wanted to do i want to be president of the united states and the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate republicans and independents as well as a firedup democratic base and not just done at once i have done it three times i think winning matters i think a track record of getting things done matters and i also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us have a wider tent have a bigger coalition and yes longer coattails that matters,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you senator finished,8
Pete Buttigieg, ive got to respond to that senator i know that if you just go by vote totals maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you if you want to talk about the capacity to win try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80 of the vote as a gay dude and mike pences indiana,8
Amna Nawaz, ,8
Amy Klobuchar, if you had won in indiana that would be one thing you tried and you lost by 20 points,8
Bernie Sanders, lets talk about how excuse me lets talk about how we win an election which is something everybody here wants to do in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in american history so let me tell you how youre win it you have the largest voter turnout in the history of america and you dont have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement and you know create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own america and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in america we need a progressive agenda medicare for all raising the minimum wage to a living wage leading the world in combating climate change making public colleges and universities,8
Amna Nawaz, thank you,8
Bernie Sanders, available to all because we have free tuition or intensely oh student debt in this country,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator sanders id like to turn to a new subject and that is of course education senator warren you propose free public college tuition and student loan forgiveness for most families why should wealthy families be able to send their kids to public college for free why not concentrate that government help on those most in need,8
E. Warren, so as ive talked about before i have a 2 cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies age zero to five to put an historic 800 billion investment in public schools k through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school 2year college 4year college for every single person who wants an education cancel student loan debt four 50 put a 50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans,8
E. Warren, look this is about money but this is also about values we need to make an investment in our future and the best way to do that is lets invest in the public education of our children that starts when theyre babies and it goes long after high school we want to have families i meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt thats why i have a proposal popular among democrats popular among republicans popular among independents to ask those at the top to pay a little more so somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves start a small business buy a car create a future for themselves and for this country,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator i see some hands but i want to go to mayor buttigiege mayor buttigiege your plan offers free or discounted public college only to families making up to 150000 a year do you think senator warrens plan offers free college to too many families,8
Pete Buttigieg, i do think that if youre in that lucky top 10 i still wish you well dont get me wrong i just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that but if youre not top 10 i think youre going to be for the most part okay and there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes so i very much agree with senator warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires i just dont agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition,8
E. Warren, so wait he mentioned me by name,8
Yamiche A., thank you mayor thank you mayor buttigiege i want to im going to let you respond senator warren,8
E. Warren, look the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids i want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids because thats how we build a future the other part is weve got to deal with student loan debt and right now most of the people on the stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionately affects people of color african americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school more likely to borrow more money while theyre in school and have a harder time paying it off we want to make an investment in the future then open up education for all of our kids thats how we build our future,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator senator sanders you can nor respond to it,8
Bernie Sanders, i believe in the concept of universality and one of the crises in america today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms so youre not eligible for the program today because youre at 150 but youll lost your job by eligible youve got a better job youre eligible i think what we have to do is what we do with social security what we do with public education donald trumps kids can go to a public school they should be able to go to a public school what we all need right now is a revolution in education we have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality affordable childcare we need to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree and by taxing billionaires and by taxing wall street we will cancel all student debt in this country,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator sanders tim,8
Tim Alberta, switching gears here mrsteyer earlier this year in iowa i met a father bill stumps and his son kyle and dubuque kyle is a remarkable young adults with significant disabilities and though hes been employed for about five years at a local pizza parlor the future is very uncertain for his family bill worries that there arent enough jobs living facilities social programs designed to meet the needs of his son so im wondering as president are there specific steps that you would take to help people like kyle become more integrated into the workforce and into their local communities,8
Tom Steyer, look the united states has made a commitment to treat everybody equally and that means supporting people with disabilities both in terms of education and later when theyre part of the workforce that means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that were treating them fairly in school and after school to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible,8
Tom Steyer, the question weve got here across the board is can we afford to do the kinds of things that senator sanders and senator warren are pushing and the answer is yes but in fact what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich americans and big corporations last year the top 400 corporations paid an 11 tax that is absolutely ludicrous,8
Amy Klobuchar, could i answer the crisis ,8
Tom Steyer, the answer on disability is a question of focus and money as so many of these questions are we have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it theyre getting their way and for us to get back to government of by and for the people that serves americans including americans with disabilities were going to have to take that back for the sake,8
Tim Alberta, mr yang i didnt hear a specific answer from mr steyer can you outline specific steps that the government should take to help integrate these young people into the workforce and into their local communities,8
Andrew Yang, i would love it i have a son with special needs and to me special needs is the new normal in this country how many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism if you look around most hands went up the fact is right now we have to do more for kyle special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases and heres the challenge we go to employers and say hey this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace which may be correct but thats not the point we have to stop confusing economic value in human value we have to be able to say to our kids and kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an american and you are a human being,8
Andrew Yang, were going to put a freedom dividend of 1000 a month in everyones hands which is going to help families around the country adapt and then were going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority not a local one so not not robbing peter to pay paul,8
Tim Alberta, thank you mr yang we have to move on judy,8
E. Warren, no come on,8
Tim Alberta, senator warren 45 seconds,8
E. Warren, so i was a special education teacher and i loved that work because it gave me a chance to work straight up with people to recognize the worth of every human being i had four to 46yearolds who were in special ed and what do we need to do thats why i have a plan as a special ed teacher to fully fund idea so every child with disabilities will get the full education they need,8
E. Warren, my housing plan is about investing in more housing across this country and rural america and urban america in small town america but its also about making sure that people who want to live independently people who have disabilities will have housing available to them i make a part of my job to spill that we are going to make sure as president i will make sure that the people who want to bid on federal contracts are treating people with disabilities fairly and paying them fairly youve got to go at it at every part of what we do because as a nation this is truly a measure of who we are we believe in treating these the least of thy brethren as people of value and that is how we make a better america,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator warren judy,8
Judy, i know we have a lot of hands up we have so many important topics to discuss i want to come to you senator klobuchar on a question of the judges president trump has appointed as we know two supreme court justices but hes also had confirmed nearly 200 federal judges most of whom are young and could shape american law for decades to come some of them you voted for in the senate including one who just yesterday joined a ruling to strike down a key part of the affordable care act would president trumps appointees my question is make it harder for you as president for any of you on this stage to enact your agenda,8
Amy Klobuchar, of course and i want to make it clear that ive opposed many many judges and i think everyone will remember what happened at the kavanaugh hearing when that nominee went after me i stood my ground and he had to apologize so i have been very strong on these judges as for the judge you just referred to there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a that went through the senate unanimously with support by senator sanders with support by president obama with support by then senator kennedy so i think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they arent but what would i do as president i would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like elena kagan and justice pryor and sonia sotomayor and lets not forget the notorious rbg thats what i would do,8
Amy Klobuchar, and if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the judiciary committee look at the judges that i recommended to president obama people like mimi wright whos a superstar and susan richard nelson look at who i put in as the first openly gay marshall in the history of the united states i did that because i knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow but you also have to do it right away that is one thing that we all learn from when president obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these trump judges,8
Judy, a followup to mayor buttigiege beyond a pledge not to overturn roe versus wade which i believe all of you have said would be part of your decision making and choosing a nominee to the court are there other litmus tests that you would apply in choosing federal judges,8
Pete Buttigieg, the supreme court is very personal for me because my household my marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on that body and yes it is critical that we have justices who understand that american freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom but thats not all i expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights i expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and i expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield which is why i will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history so that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up,8
Judy, yamiche,8
Yamiche A., senator sanders at least 22 transgender people were killed in the united states this year most of them transgender women of color each of you have said you would push for the passage of the equality act a comprehensive lgbtq civil rights bill but if elected what more would you do to stop violence against transgender people,8
Bernie Sanders, we need moral leadership in the white house we need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community against the african american community against the latino community and against all minorities in this country but above and beyond providing the moral leadership of trying to bring our people together what we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs and that is why i strongly support and have helped lead the effort for a medicare for all single payer program which will provide comprehensive healthcare to all people including certainly the transgender community,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator sanders senator warren,8
E. Warren, the transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible and one thing that the president of the united states can do is lift up attention lift up their voices lift up their lives heres a promise i made i will go to the rose garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year i will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness i will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification i will do everything i can to make sure that we are in america that leaves no one behind,8
Yamiche A., thank you senator warren,8
Amna Nawaz, vice president biden lets turn now to a afghanistan confidential documents published last week by the washington post revealed that four years senior us officials misled the public about the war in afghanistan as vice president,8
Joe Biden, afghanistan you said,8
Amna Nawaz, yes sir afghanistan,8
Joe Biden, ,8
Amna Nawaz, as vice president what did you know about the state of the war and do you believe that you were honest with the american people about it,8
Joe Biden, the reason i can speak to this its well known if any of you followed my view on afghanistan i was sent by the president before we got sworn in to afghanistan to come back with a report i said there was comprehensive policy available and then i got in a big fight for a long time with the pentagon because i strongly opposed the nation building notion we set about rebuilding that country as a as a whole nation is beyond our capacity i argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an antiterrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the united states of america,8
Joe Biden, the first thing i would do as president the united states of america is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home and into a negotiation with the taliban but i would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism thats been my position from the beginning thats why i think secretary gates and some members of the pentagon werent happy with me,8
Amna Nawaz, mr biden the question was about your time in the white house though and in that washington post report theres a senior national security official who said that there was constant pressure from the obama white house to produce figures showing the troop surge was working and im quoting from the report here despite hard evidence to the contrary what do you say to that,8
Joe Biden, since 2009,8
Amy Klobuchar, hard evidence to the contrary what do you say to that,8
Joe Biden, since 2009 go back and look i was on the opposite side of that with the pentagon  i can speak to it now is because its been published its been published thoroughly im the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big big mistake to surge forces to afghanistan period we should not have done it and i argued against it constantly,8
Amy Klobuchar, senator sanders you had your hand up,8
Bernie Sanders, in all due respect to joe joe youre also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in iraq what we need to do is i think rethink and the washington post piece was very educational what we need to rethink is the entire war on terror we have lost thousands of our own men and women brave soldiers hundreds of thousands if not millions of people have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries it is time right now that we bring this world together to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes which are causing these wars,8
Amy Klobuchar, senator sanders you do often point to your vote against the war in iraq is evidence of your judgment on foreign policy but you did vote for the war in afghanistan and as recently as 2015 you said you supported a continued u s troop presence there was that support a mistake,8
Bernie Sanders, well only one person my good friend barbara lee was right on that issue she was the only person in the house to vote against the war in afghanistan she was right i was wrong so was everybody else in the house but to answer your question i dont think you do what trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 300 am in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the kurds i think you work with the international community you remove all troops over a period of time a short period of time within one year,8
Amy Klobuchar, thank you senator mayor buttigieg you served in this war but i want to ask about your decision making if you were elected commander in chief you have pledged to withdrawal all us troops from a afghanistan within your first year as president but the taliban today control or contest more than half the country so should you as president still withdrawal all those u s troops if the country could once again become a haven for terrorists,8
Pete Buttigieg, were going to leave one way or the other the question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly and of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement but the other day i was reunited with somebody that i served with over there and the thing we were marveling at is how long its been since we left i thought i was one of the last troops turning out the lights when i left years ago and were still there there may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity the exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in syria holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos but what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars,8
Pete Buttigieg, and im glad that the name of barbara lee was mentioned not only because of what shes talked about years ago i believe that we had no choice but to go to afghanistan after 911 but right now she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that i served with deserve that they deserve the clarity of members of congress being able to summon the courage to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when i am president anytime if i am forced to deploy troops into war anytime we seek an authorization it will have a three year sunset so that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it it has to be brought to congress brought to the american people and those members of congress have to take that tough up or down vote,8
Amy Klobuchar, thank you mr mayor tim,8
Tim Alberta, thanks moving to healthcare an issue that voters tell us every day is still the number one priority for them senator sanders youve spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your medicare for all plan but the reality is that if republicans retain control of the u s senate or even if democrats win back a narrow senate majority your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass congress so the question senator is if congress rejects your plan and the american people are looking to you for leadership on this issue are there smaller specific measures that you would take immediately to expand coverage and decrease costs as president,8
Bernie Sanders, well tim at a time when were spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation when 87 million people are uninsured or under insured when 30000 people are dying each year because they dont get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have you know what i think we will pass a medicare for all single payer system,8
Bernie Sanders, and i will introduce that legislation in my first week in office now to answer your question i think when we go out to the american people and tell them that right now we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry for example which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as its charged in this country where the american people understand that medicare for all expands medicare to cover home health care dental care eyeglasses and hearing aids and does it at a cost far far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about you know what were going to have the american people behind us we will have congress behind it,8
Tim Alberta,  thank you senator sanders vice president biden id like to bring you in you spent an awful lot of time 10 years ago trying to pass a bill far less ambitious than what senator sanders is talking about here is he being realistic,8
Joe Biden, i dont think it is realistic but let me explain why i introduced a plan to build on obamacare it remind everybody 20 million people got insurance didnt have it before all people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered i could go on we didnt get all that we wanted but now that its been exposed that taking it away has such dire consequences ive added to the obamacare plan the biden initiative which is a public option medicare if you want to have medicarefor reducing significantly the price of drugs deductibles et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about 750 billion dollars and making sure that were able to cover everyone who is in fact able to be covered it put your hand down for a second bernie okay,8
Bernie Sanders, just waving to you joe,8
Joe Biden, i know so look it covers everybody its realistic and most importantly it lets you choose what you want here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer like many of you had you may or may not like it if you dont like it you can move into the public option that i proposed in my plan but if you like it you shouldnt have washington dictating you you can not keep the plan you have thats a fun,8
Tim Alberta, thank you vice president biden  senator sanders 45 seconds to respond,8
Bernie Sanders, under joes plan essentially we retain the status quo,8
Joe Biden, thats not true ,8
Bernie Sanders, that is exactly true thank you and by the way joe under your plan you asked me how are we going to pay for it under your plan ill tell you how were paying for right now the average worker in america their family makes 60000 a year that family is now paying 12000 a year for health care 20 of the income or the medicare for all that family will be paying 1200 a year because were eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending theres byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans,8
Tim Alberta,  45 seconds for vice president biden,8
Joe Biden, im the only guy thats not interrupted here all right im going to interrupt now it costs 30 trillion dollars lets get that straight 30 trillion over 10 years some say it costs 20 trillion some say it cost 40 the idea that youre going to be able to save that person making 60000 a year on medicare for all is absolutely preposterous 16 of the american public is on medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now tell me youre going to add 84 more and its not going to be higher taxes at least before he was honest about it its going to increase personal taxes theyre going to be,8
Bernie Sanders, thats right we all got to increase personal taxes but were eliminating premiums were eliminating copayments were eliminating deductibles were eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in america will spend more than 200 a year on prescription drugs ,8
Amy Klobuchar, hey,8
Bernie Sanders, its first time i did this,8
Amy Klobuchar, okay thats true ill say this first of all bernie i promise when i am your president i will get our pharmaceutical bills done and we have worked together on this time and time again and i agree with you on that but where i disagree is i just dont think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time that is why i favor a public option which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then well expand coverage to 12 million people,8
Amy Klobuchar, but heres the political problem this fight that you guys are having isnt real your fight bernie is not with me or with vice president biden it is with all those bunch of those new house members not everyone by any means that got elected in that last election in the democratic party it is with the new governor democratic governor of kentucky that wants to build on obamacare and the way i look at it if you want to cross a river over some trouble waters you build a bridge you dont blow one up and i think we should build on the affordable care act ,8
Bernie Sanders, she took my name in vain she hurt my feelings ,8
Tim Alberta, 45 seconds senator sanders,8
Bernie Sanders, all right my fight amy its not with the governor of kentucky my fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry with the greed and corruption of the insurance industry these guys last year made 100 billion in profit and tens of millions of americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight the day has got to come and joe is not talking about it amy is not talking about it the day has got to come and i will bring that day about what we finally say that the drug companies and the insurance companies the function of health care is that provided for all of our people in a cost effective way not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies ,8
Tim Alberta, wed like to bring you into this discussion the same question to you that i posed to senator sanders if congress rejects a medicare for all proposal and youre the president are there smaller specific measures that you could pursue with bipartisan support to decrease costs and expand coverage,8
E. Warren, so this is about costs its about costs on middle class families last year 36 million americans didnt have a prescription filled because they couldnt afford it and those are people with health insurance as well people who cant do the copays people who cant do the deductibles people who find out that the drug is not covered so heres how i approach this i want to do the most good i can for the most people as quickly as possible on day one im going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs like epipens and insulin and bring down those prices,8
E. Warren, the president can do that i love saying this all by herself and i will do it thats going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars and then in the first hundred days because i found a way to pay for full healthcare coverage for everyone without raising taxes on middle class families im going to make available to people for a full healthcare coverage for 135 million people itll be at no cost at all and they can opt into that system for others it will be at a low cost we have got to start moving and move fast  and do that we can do that on 50 votes,8
Tim Alberta, thank you senator judy,8
Judy, we are coming to the end of our time a lot of hands up we apologize for that but in the spirit of the season id like to ask each one of you is there someone else among these candidates that you would have you have two options one a candidate from whom you would ask forgiveness for something maybe that was said tonight or another time or a candidate to whom you would like to give a gift and im going to start with you mr yang,8
Andrew Yang, wow,8
E. Warren, we can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one andrew,8
Tim Alberta, i dont think i have much to ask forgiveness for or you all can correct me on this in terms of a gift elizabeth has done me the honor of starting to read my book i would love to give each of you a copy of my book its about how were going through the greatest economic transformation in our countrys history the fourth industrial revolution it is grinding up our communities and dc is out to lunch on this our media organizations are not covering it adequately i wrote a book on it and if you like data this book is for you this goes for the people at home too if you like data and books,8
Judy, mayor buttigieg ask forgiveness or give a gift,8
Pete Buttigieg, well first of all i love data and books so i think we should all be excited about this and come to think of it i should probably send my book around more to look i think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day we know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of the united states compared to what weve got and we got to remember there i dont know how many now were up to 25 something have run for president in the democratic party the moment weve got a nominee the 24 who arent that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does lets make sure theres not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes,8
Judy, senator warren,8
E. Warren, i will ask for forgiveness i know that sometimes i get really worked up and sometimes i get a little hot i dont really mean to what happens is when you do 100000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments i met someone just last week in nevada who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because hes a veteran but his sister has diabetes his daughter has diabetes and they simply cant afford insulin so the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people when i think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house a majority in the senate and get back the white house we could make this country work for people like that man and thats why im in this fight,8
Judy, vice president biden,8
E. Warren, i think everyone up here on this stage and those are not on the stage whove run we owe them because theyre all pushing for the same exact thing youre not the only one that does senator ive done thousands of them and the crew that follows me can tell you theres not one line i go through i dont have at least to have a dozen people come up and hug me and say can you help me i just lost my daughter 10 days ago can you help me tell me am i going to be okay can you help me i just lost  and theyd go and lay out their problems my wife and i have a call list of somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them im here,8
E. Warren, i give them my private phone number they keep in touch with me a little kid who says stuttering i cant talk what do i do i have scores of these young women and men who i keep in contact with and the reason i would give everyone here at gift is because they want to do something like i do of making their lives better because theres a lot of people who are hurting very very very badly,8
Judy, senator sanders forgiveness or a gift,8
Bernie Sanders, well i can give out any one of four books that i wrote but i think the gift that all of us need to give to the american people is a very different vision of the reality of the trump administration and the vision that we need to bring forth is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion not greed and hatred we need a vision which says that in our great country all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living have health care have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income so we need a new vision which brings our people together around an agenda that works for all not the trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class thats my vision,8
Judy, senator klobuchar,8
Amy Klobuchar, well id ask for forgiveness anytime any of you get mad at me i can be blunt but i am doing this because i think it is so important to pick the right candidate here i do i think when you see whats going on around the country yes its the economic check that elizabeth and bernie have so well pointed out on this stage but theres something else going on here and it is a decency check it is a values check it is a patriotism check when you see people and weve all had this happen that come to our meetings and say yeah i voted for donald trump but i dont want to do it again because i want my kids to be able to watch the president on tv and not mute the tv we have to remember as democrats and if i get worked up about this its because i believe its so much in my heart that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out that is the gift we can give america in this election,8
Judy, mr steyer,8
Tom Steyer, so look this is the holiday season and what im hearing from every single one of these candidates is that theyve gone around the united states and what theyve seen from this administration and what theyve seen from the republican party is cruelty towards the people of the united states for money so when i think about the gift that id like to give and ive seen that too i mean i think it starts with cruelty when children are born and it goes right through life into prek education health care a living wage there is cruelty to working people theres cruelty to seniors,8
Tom Steyer, and so the gift that id like to give everyone on this stage which was the original question is the gift of teamwork because the question up here is how are we together going to change this framework how are we together going to beat this corrupt and criminal president how are we going to stand up for the people of the united states together not by tearing each other down but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of america and as a team thats how were going to do it and as americans were going to come together to stand up for the original values freedom equality justice teamwork,8
Judy, we are going to take a very short break that does conclude our questions tonight here at loyola marymount university well be back in just two minutes to hear the candidates closing statements,8
Judy Woodruff, welcome back to the pbs news hour democratic debate with politico and now its time for closing statements,8
Judy Woodruff, each have 60 seconds beginning with mr steyer,8
Tom Steyer, im different from everybody else on this stage and heres why im running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people and for the last 10 years thats exactly what ive been doing taking on unchecked corporate power thats why im for term limits because if were going to have bold change then we need new people in charge and new ideas im the only person on this stage whos built a large multi billion dollar international business i know how to grow prosperity i can take on mr trump on the economy and beat him im the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority its a crisis we have to deal with but its also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where its so essential so if you want to break the corporate stranglehold beat mr trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis i can deliver,8
Judy Woodruff, mr yang,8
Tom Steyer, and im asking for your vote,8
Judy Woodruff, sorry my apology for interrupting mr yang,8
Andrew Yang, i know what youre thinking america how am i still on this stage with them ,8
Andrew Yang, our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser focused on solving the real problems that got donald trump elected in the first place i spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in detroit baltimore new orleans and other cities serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under president obama and i saw firsthand what many of you already know our country is falling apart our senior citizens are working until the day they die our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs were seeing record high levels of depression suicides overdoses our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger our way of life is changing faster than ever and the simple fact is this our politicians in d c succeed whether we the people succeed or fail washington dc today is the richest city in our country what do they produce bad decisions we need to get the money out of dc and into your hands the hands of the american people join us in yang2020com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you senator  senator klobuchar,8
Amy Klobuchar, we have had quite a debate tonight but i want to debate donald trump this primary comes down to some simple questions who has the best ideas the best experience mostly who can beat donald trump and how will she do it so donald trump built his fortune on over time over 413 million that he got from his dad my grandpa he was an iron ore miner a union member who worked 1500 feet underground and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a community college thats my family trust,8
Amy Klobuchar, and i figure if you are given opportunity you dont go into the world with a sense of entitlement you go into it with a sense of obligation an obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself our politics right now because of donald trump are toxic we need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way so if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me if you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails join me we will win at amyklobucharcom,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you  mayor buttigieg,8
Pete Buttigieg, so the nominee is going to have to do two things defeat donald trump and unite the country as president its a tall order and in order to do it were going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today that means building up a politics that is defined not by who we exclude not by who we reject but by how many people we can call to this side i have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial multi generational coalition and im seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the democratic party before but belong here now because theyre definitely not on board with whats going on in the trump white house i am asking you to join me to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging,8
Judy Woodruff, senator warren,8
E. Warren, did you call my name this is a dark moment in america and yet i come here tonight with a heart filled with hope all three of my brothers served in the military theyre all retired theyre all back in oklahoma one is a democrat two are republicans but you know what unites my three brothers amazon they are furious that amazon reported 10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes my brothers are part of why is ready to root out corruption and fight back and that gives us a base to work from america is ready for 2 cent wealth tax its supported by republicans democrats and independents and it lets us invest in all of our children,8
E. Warren, america is ready to expand social security payments and disability payments by 200 a month and we can do it you know someone asks what this would mean you just give somebody 200 a month they asked me this in a town hall and a lady who wanted it said you know what it will mean to me itll mean i can get a prescription filled and i can still buy toilet paper this same week thats where americans are right now i am not working for millionaires and billionaires im here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an america that wont just work those at the top but that will work for everyone,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you senator sanders,8
Bernie Sanders, 45 years americans have been listening to great speeches and at the end of the day the average american worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages over those 45 years the truth is that real change always takes place real change always takes place from the bottom on up never from the top on down and that is why in this campaign i am so proud that we have over a million volunteers we have some of the strongest grassroots organizations we have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in american history please join the political revolution berniesanderscom lets defeat trump lets transform this country thank you,8
Judy Woodruff, and finally vice president biden,8
Joe Biden, thank you very much for listening seven days out christmas thank you very much look we all have big progressive plans and the question is who can deliver on those plans and it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly who has the best chance most likely chance of defeating donald trump who is the one whos most likely to do that number two who can help elect democrats to the united states senate in states like north carolina and georgia and arizona and other states,8
Joe Biden, and thirdly who can deliver legislatively that requires you to look at our records i have a significant record of getting significant things done from the violence against women act and the chemical weapons treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike and so i think asking those questions i believe as you expect that im the most qualified to answer those three questions but most of all weve got to level with the american people dont play games with them tell them the truth and be authentic god bless you all and may you all have a great great holiday season and thank you guys for doing this as well,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you very much and that concludes the pbs news hour politico debate i do want to thank my colleagues here at the moderator table tim alberta of politico amna nawaz and yamiche alcindor of the pbs news hour,8
Judy Woodruff, thank you all for joining us please stick around and watch pbs for some analysis thank you to the candidates,8
Bernie Sanders, when the congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in iraq invade iraq i got up on the floor of the house and i said that would be a disaster it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region and id not only voted against the wall i help lead the effort against that wall just last year i helped for the first time in the modern history of this country pass a war powers act resolution working with a conservative republican mike lee of utah which said that the war in yemen led by saudi arabia was unconstitutional because congress had not authorized it,9
Bernie Sanders, we got a majority vote in the senate we got a majority vote in the house unfortunately bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues i am able to work with republicans i am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table not through military efforts,9
Wolf Blitzer, vice president biden you talk a lot about your experience but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the iraq war why are you the best prepared person in this stage to be commander in chief,9
Joe Biden, i said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if in fact he couldnt get inspectors into iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon it was a mistake and i acknowledged that but the man who also argued against that war barack obama picked me to be his vice president and once we were elected president and vice president he turned to me and asked me to end that war i know what its like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in afghanistan my son for a year in iraq and thats why i do it very very reluctantly,9
Joe Biden, thats why i led the effort as you know wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into afghanistan we should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of united states are at stake they were not at stake there they were not at stake in iraq and it was a mistaken vote but i think my record overall on every other thing weve done has been im prepared to compare it to anybodys on this stage,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator sanders you have been attacking vice president bidens vote on the iraq war but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in afghanistan was also a mistake so youve both acknowledged mistakes why should the american people trust your judgment more,9
Bernie Sanders, well its a little bit of a difference on that particular vote every single member of the house including myself voted for it only barbara lee voted against it but what i understood from right away in terms of the war in iraq the difference here is that the war in iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country as joe well knows we lost 4500 brave troops hundreds of thousands of iraqis died,9
Bernie Sanders, we have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country joe and i listened to what dick cheney and george bush and rumsfeld had to say i thought they were lying i didnt believe them for a moment i took to the floor i did everything i could to prevent that war joe saw it differently,9
Wolf Blitzer, vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, i was asked to bring 156000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort it was a mistake to trust that they werent going to go to war they said they were not going to go to war they said they were just going to get inspectors in the world in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war from that point on i was in the position of making the case that it was a big big mistake and from that point on i moved to bring those troops home,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator klobuchar youve publicly questioned mayor buttigiegs experience when it comes to being commander in chief why is your time as a us senator more valuable than his time as a us naval intelligence officer in afghanistan and as mayor,9
Amy Klobuchar, thank you wolf and ive been very clear that i respect the mayors experience very much in the military i just have different experience ive been in the us senate for over 12 years and i think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions i will look at my position on the iraq war first i wasnt in the senate for that vote but i opposed that war from the very beginning in my first campaign for senate i ran against a republican who ran ads against me on it but i stood my ground when i got to the senate i pushed to bring our troops home,9
Amy Klobuchar, then i have dealt with every issue from afghanistan to keeping our troops with good healthcare after what we saw with walter reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare i think right now what we should be talking about though wolfe is what is happening right now with donald trump donald trump is taking us pellmell toward another war we have a very important resolution,9
Amy Klobuchar, we just found out today the four republicans are joining democrats to go to him and say you must have an authorization of military force if youre going to go to war with iran that is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the iranian nuclear agreement something i on for a significant period of time as president i will get us back into that agreement i will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and i will mean it,9
Wolf Blitzer, thank you senator klobuchar we are going to continue talking about whos best prepared to be commander in chief mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, well i bring a different perspective there are enlisted people that i served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 911 on the war in iraq and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates the next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything weve seen before,9
Pete Buttigieg, not just conventional military challenges not just stateless terrorism but cybersecurity challenges climate security challenges foreign interference in our elections its going to take a view to the future as well as the readiness to learn from the lessons of the past and for me those lessons of the past are personal,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator warren and our new cnn des moines register poll almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours why are you best prepared to be commander in chief,9
E. Warren, i believe the principal job of the commander in chief is to keep america safe and i think thats about judgment i think it starts with knowing our military i sit on the senate armed services committee i work with our generals with our military leaders with our intelligence but i also visit our troops i visit our troops around the world ive been to afghanistan to iraq to jordan to south korea ive been to lots of places to talk with our troops and i fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay that they get the housing and medical benefits that theyve been promised that they dont get cheated by giant financial institutions,9
E. Warren, i have three brothers who are in the military and i know how much our military families sacrifice but i also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways we have to think about cyber we have to think about climate we also have to think about how we spend money we have a problem with a revolving door in washington between the defense industry and the department of defense and the pentagon that is corruption pure and simple we need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget we need to depend on all of our tools diplomatic economic working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots,9
Wolf Blitzer, mr steyer you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander in chief,9
Tom Steyer, i worked internationally around the world for decades i traveled i met with governments i met with business and i understand how america interacts with other countries and you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts and to me i believe that senator warren made a great point it isnt so much about experience its about judgment if youve been listening to this what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the american government in the middle east of failure of mistakes so the real question is judgment,9
Tom Steyer, and if you look who had the judgment it was a state senator from illinois with no experience named barack obama who opposed the war it is a congress woman barbara lee from oakland california who stood up against the original vote who was the only person in congress so i would say to you this an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what were looking for now i agree with senator warren we are spending dramatically too much money on defense the money that were spending there we could spend in the other parts of the budget and its time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what were trying to do and how to do it,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator sanders in the wake of the iran crisis iran ayatollah khamenei has again called for all us troops to be pulled out of the middle east something youve called for as well yet when american troops last left iraq isis emerged and spread terror across the middle east and indeed around the world how would you prevent that from happening again,9
Bernie Sanders, okay let me tell you but before i tell you that let me tell you something else and that is and i dont know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not maybe they will but what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in vietnam and the war in iraq both of those wars were based on lies and right now what i fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in iraq,9
Bernie Sanders, to answer your question what we need to do is have an international coalition we cannot keep acting unilaterally as you know the nuclear deal with iran was worked on with a number of our allies we have got to undo what trump did bring that coalition together and make sure that iran never gets a nuclear weapon,9
Wolf Blitzer, vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, i was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with iran bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who arent friendly to us and it was working it was working it was being held tightly there was no movement on the part of the iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon and look whats happened he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement trump what exactly would happened were now isolated were in a situation where our allies in europe are making a comparison between the united states and iran saying both ought to stand down making a moral equivalence we have lost our standing in the region we have lost the support of our allies the next president has to be able to pull those folks back together reestablish our alliances and insist that iran go back into the agreement which i believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done,9
Wolf Blitzer, so just to be clear vice president biden would you leave troops in the middle east or would you pull them out,9
Joe Biden, i would leave troops in the middle east in terms of patrolling the gulf where we are now small numbers of troops and i think its a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with isis whats happened is now that hes gone ahead the president and started this whole process moving whats happening isis is going to reconstitute itself were in a position where we have to pull our forces out americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank i think hes flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator klobuchar whats your response,9
Amy Klobuchar, i would leave some troops there but not in the level that donald trump is taking us right now afghanistan i have long wanted to bring our troops home i would do that some would remain for counter terrorism and training in syria i would not have removed 150 troops from the border with turkey i think that was a mistake i think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to isis and then when it comes to iraq right now i would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by donald trump,9
Amy Klobuchar, at the briefing we had last week i was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state and i asked them about imminent threat but i also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague vague answers i asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if i was president and i asked them where they were going to leave the iraqi people time and time again you see that this president puts his own interest his private interests in front of our countries i would put our countrys interests first as commander in chief,9
Wolf Blitzer, so senator warren leave combat troops at least some combat troops in the middle east or bring them home,9
E. Warren, no i think we need to get our combat troops out you know we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily our keeping combat troops there is not helping we need to work with our allies we need to use our economic tools we need to use our diplomatic tools,9
E. Warren, now look i understand there are people on this stage when it comes to afghanistan for example who talk about five more years 10 more years shoot lindsay graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years no one has a solution and an end point we need to get our combat troops out they are not helping create more safety for the united states or the region,9
Wolf Blitzer, vice president biden is senator warren right,9
Joe Biden, well ill tell you what theres a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position i was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states not us alone 68 other countries thats how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for isis theyll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us with small numbers of special forces we have to organize the effort to take them down,9
Wolf Blitzer, mayor buttigieg you served in afghanistan whos right,9
Pete Buttigieg, if we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops but whats going on right now is the presidents actually sending more the very president who said he was going to end endless war who pretended to have been against the war in iraq all along but we know thats not true now has more troops going into the middle east and whenever i see that happen i think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members,9
Pete Buttigieg, i remember walking with a friend of mine another lieutenant i trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasnt turning back to scoop him up and it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time that is happening by the thousands right now as we see so many more troops sent into harms way and my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander in chief,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator sanders,9
Bernie Sanders, wolf in america today our infrastructure is crumbling half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck 87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured you got 500000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight the american people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars our job is to rebuild the united nations rebuild the state department make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced,9
Wolf Blitzer, were going to get to everyone but vice president biden you criticized president trumps decision to kill the iranian general soleimani without first going to congress are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the united states where you would take military action without congressional approval,9
Joe Biden, i ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in vietnam on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the american people the informed consent of the american people and with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere excluding special forces theres no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists you have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them,9
Joe Biden, if you dont we end up being the worlds policeman again theyre going to come to us theyve come to us before theyll come to us again so thats a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries its fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions,9
Wolf Blitzer, mr vice president just to be clear the obamabiden administration did not ask congress for permission multiple times when it took military action so wouldnt the biden doctrine be different,9
Joe Biden, no there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the united states congress house and senate and signed by the president that was the authority does not give authority to go into iran it gave authority to deal with these other issues,9
Wolf Blitzer, mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, that authorization needs to be replaced,9
Joe Biden, exactly we tried that,9
Pete Buttigieg, when we lost troops in  there were members of congress who admitted they didnt even know we had troops there and it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with al qaeda and 911 and often congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role now thanks to democrats in congress thats changing but the reality is year after year congress didnt want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult fundamental truth is if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harms way often on deployment after deployment then weve got to make sure that congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there and when i am president anytime which i hope will never happen but anytime im compelled to use force i seek that authorization we will have a three year sunset so that the american people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue,9
Wolf Blitzer, thank you were going to get to everyone but senator warren what about you are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the united states where you would take military action without congressional approval,9
E. Warren, well imminent threat but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat that is what the constitution provides and thats what as commander in chief i will do but i just want to be clear everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it on senate armed services committee we have one general after another in afghanistan who comes in and says you know weve just turned the corner and now its all going to be different,9
E. Warren, and then what happens its all the same for another year someone new comes in and weve just turned the corner weve turned the corners so many times were going in circles in these regions this has got to stop its not enough to say someday were going to get out no one on the ground none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out its time to get our combat troops home,9
Wolf Blitzer, mr steyer would a presidents steyer use military force as a deterrent and if not under what circumstances would you take military action,9
Tom Steyer, i would take military action to protect the lives and safety of american citizens but what we can see in the middle east and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that were trying to accomplish in what were doing in the middle east obviously mr trump has no strategy he is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation but if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in afghanistan we know from the washington post that in fact there was no strategy there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense,9
Tom Steyer, so we really have to ask ourselves in the middle east what are we trying to accomplish i agree with vice president biden to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries and i want to point out that as we do that were confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about but at the same time theres a gigantic climate issue in australia which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building that we actually should be using in the middle east we need to ask ourselves how are we going to provide a world that is safer for americans where we can prosper more and every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and its just not happening in washington dc,9
Abby Phillip, mayor buttigieg another critical issue youd face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons last week president trump said as long as i am president of the united states iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon would a president buttigieg make that same promise,9
Pete Buttigieg, ensuring that iran does not develop nuclear weapons will of course be a priority because its such an important part of keeping america safe but unfortunately president trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal by gutting the iran nuclear deal one that by the way the trump administration itself admitted was working certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear iran by gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that were now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war now  yes,9
Abby Phillip, continue,9
Pete Buttigieg, in order to get that done weve got to work with our partners the iran nuclear deal the technical term for it was the jcpoa that first letter j stood for joint we cant do this alone even less so now after everything that has happened which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what i believe is not just an american goal but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that iran does not become a nuclear armed country,9
Abby Phillip, mayor buttigieg to be clear would you allow iran to become a nuclear power yes or no,9
Pete Buttigieg, no our security depends on ensuring that iran does not become nuclear and by the way weve got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world despite this presidents coziness with vladimir putin we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with russia on things like the renewal of start weve got to move toward less not more nuclear danger whether it is from states from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world,9
Abby Phillip, thank you mayor buttigieg senator klobuchar if you become president its very possible there wont be an iran nuclear deal for the united states to rejoin given that how would you prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon,9
Amy Klobuchar, i would start negotiations again and i wont take that as a given given that our european partners are still trying to hold the agreement together my issue is that because of the actions of donald trump we are in a situation where they are now starting iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement so what i would do is negotiate i would bring people together just as president obama did years ago and i think that we can get this done but you have to have a president that sees this as a number one goal and an answer to the original question you asked the mayor i would not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon and then you have to get an agreement in place,9
Amy Klobuchar, i think there are changes you can make to the agreement better sunsets and changes to the inspections but overall that is what we should do and i am the one person on this debate stage on the first night of the very first debate when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world i said china on the economy but i said iran because of donald trump because i feared that exactly what happened would happen enrichment of uranium escalation of tensions leaving frayed relations with our allies we can bring them back understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon,9
Abby Phillip, vice president biden i want to ask you about north korea president trump has met with kim jongun three times president obama once said he would meet with north korea without any preconditions would you meet with north korea without any preconditions,9
Joe Biden, no not now i wouldnt meet with him without any preconditions look we gave him everything hes looking for legitimacy the president showed up met with him gave him legitimacy weakened the sanctions we have against them i would be putting what i did as vice president ive met with xi jinping more than anyone else i would be putting pressure on china to put pressure on korea to cease and desist from their nuclear power make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons i would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively wolf about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons,9
Joe Biden, and when china said to me when xi jinping said to me thats a threat to us i said were going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it i would reignite the relationship between japan and south korea and i would put enormous pressure on china because its also in their interest for them to put pressure on north korea to cease and desist but i would not meet with absent preconditions i would not meet with the supreme leader who said joe biden is a rabid dog he should be beaten to death with a stick i count that,9
Bernie Sanders, other than that you like him,9
Joe Biden, other than that i like him and he got a love letter from trump right after that,9
Abby Phillip, mr steyer would you meet with north korea without any preconditions,9
Tom Steyer, no its very clear that if were going to do something with north korea were going to have to do it in concert with our allies that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get but this is a classic situation where the united states idea of going it alone makes no sense and when you are talking about iran lets face it iran is under great pressure economically so every single discussion weve had about iran has had to do with military power and america versus iran whereas in fact what worked with president obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic that to me is called strategy having a goal to make america safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world,9
Abby Phillip, thank you mr steyer,9
Tom Steyer,  spending money,9
B. Pfannenstiel, lets stay with the theme of americas role in the world and talk about trade tomorrow president trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with china and the senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with mexico and canada iowas largest trading partners senator sanders you have said that new deal the usmca  makes some modest improvements yet youre going to vote against it arent modest improvements better than no improvements for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in iowa,9
Bernie Sanders, the answer is we could do much better than a trump led trade deal this deal and i think the proponents of it acknowledge will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs as a result of outsourcing the heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and im the guy who voted against nafta and against permanent normal trade relations with china is that we have forced american workers to compete against people in mexico in china elsewhere who earn starvation wages a dollar or 2 an hour,9
Bernie Sanders, second of all every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it and given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet i will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world,9
B. Pfannenstiel, but senator sanders to be clear the aflcio supports this deal are you unwilling to compromise,9
Bernie Sanders, the aflcio does the machinists union does not and every environmental organization in this country including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy opposes it so i happen to believe and i hope we will talk about climate change in a moment if we do not get our act together in terms of climate change the planet that were going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable,9
B. Pfannenstiel, were going to get to climate change but id like to stay on trade senator warren,9
Bernie Sanders, well they are the same in this issue,9
B. Pfannenstiel, senator warren you support the usmca why is senator sanders wrong,9
E. Warren, i do i wasnt here i havent been in congress long enough to have voted against nafta but i led the fight against the trade deal with asia and the trade deal with europe because i didnt think it was in the interest of the american people the american workers or environmental interests but we have farmers here in iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of donald trumps initiated trade wars we have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really dont have enforcement on workers rights,9
E. Warren, this new trade deal is a modest improvement senator sanders himself has said so it will give some relief to our farmers it will give some relief to our workers i believe we accept that relief we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal we need a coherent trade policy we need a policy that actually helps our workers our farmers we need them at the table not just a trade policy written for big international companies im ready to have that fight but lets help the people who need help right now,9
B. Pfannenstiel, thank you senator sanders can you please respond to senator warren,9
Bernie Sanders, well i think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation if this is passed i think it will set us back a number of years senator warren is right in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table that is the family farmers here in iowa and in vermont and around the country that is the environmental community that,9
Bernie Sanders, in vermont and around the country that is the environmental community that is the workers bottom line here is i am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the ceos of large corporations,9
Moderator 1, senator klobuchar id like to bring you in here,9
Amy Klobuchar, brianne i want to hit reality here i serve on the agriculture committee and i will never forget going to crawfordsville here in iowa and thank you for bringing up iowa brianne since that is where we are i went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant that plant had been shut down because of donald trumps trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard,9
Amy Klobuchar, that worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said these are my friends they dont work here anymore their names were embroidered on those uniforms derek mark salvador and that guy started to cry,9
Amy Klobuchar, these are real people hurt by donald trumps trade war so what we should do and i support the usmca i am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like richard trumka and sherrod brown on labor and environment on pharma the sweetheart deal because i think we need a big trading block with north america to take on china the way you are stronger than china is with your allies,9
Moderator 1, senator klobuchar your time is up mayor buttigieg do you support the usmca yes or no,9
Pete Buttigieg, yes it has been improved it is not perfect but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit american consumers and workers and farmers by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability as democrats ensured we got in this usmca,9
Pete Buttigieg, but lets acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration in my part of the country in the industrial midwest i remember when they came around in the 90s selling trade deals telling us dont worry about your slice of the pie the pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off and that promise was broken the part about the pie getting bigger happened its just that the part about it getting to most people where i live did not,9
Pete Buttigieg, that is why there was such frustration the sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in washington are being made not based on whats best for us but based on their own game,9
Moderator 1, thank you mayor buttigieg vice president biden senator sanders has said donald trump will quote eat your lunch for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements when it comes to trade why are you the best candidate to take on president trump,9
Joe Biden, therell be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in american workers we should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing america workers to compete in the 21st century on the high tech side dealing with artificial intelligence we should be focusing on equipping american workers to do that,9
Joe Biden, by the way the idea  i dont know that theres any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense but the problem is that 95 of the customers are out there so weve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road not china,9
Moderator 1, senator sanders,9
Bernie Sanders, joe and i have a fundamental disagreement in case you havent noticed and that is nafta pntr with china other trade agreements were written for one reason alone and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations the end result of those two just pntr with china joe and nafta cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom,9
Bernie Sanders, i am sick and tired and will not tolerate and we will use the power of the federal contracting system if a corporation in america wants to shut down in iowa or vermont or any place else and then they think theyre going to get online for a generous federal contract theyve got another thing going we need some corporate responsibility here and we need to protect goodpaying jobs in america not see them go to china mexico vietnam,9
Moderator 1, mr vice president whats your response,9
Joe Biden, we need corporate responsibility and i agree with that completely but we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made enforceable agreements thats one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with mexico and thats what we should be doing in any agreement we have,9
Joe Biden, but lets get back to the basics here if we dont set the rules of the road by going out to our partners instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies we make up 25 of the worlds economy weve got to bring the other 25 of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so china cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage,9
Moderator 1, senator warren,9
E. Warren, our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility its been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated the united states has had a strategy for decades and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators a small number and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations not good for america not good for american workers not good for the environment,9
E. Warren, we need a different approach to trade and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals everybody wants to get to the american market and we need to put some standards in place you want to be able to sell your goods here then youve got to meet some environmental standards youve got to meet labor standards,9
Moderator 1, thank you senator warren,9
E. Warren, we need a coherent approach,9
Moderator 1, id like to bring in mr steyer here mr steyer even though farmers and manufacturers here in iowa and around the country could see some relief from the china deal theyve been crushed by the current administrations trade war what will you do as president to help them get back on their feet,9
Tom Steyer, look on the first day i would undo mr trumps tariffs on the first day i would get rid of his waivers that senator klobuchar was referring to to oil refiners not having to use cornbased ethanol,9
Tom Steyer, in fact these trade deals have been exactly what senator sanders and warren have been saying which is that theyve been designed to grow the american gdp for the corporations of america not for the working people of america and not to protect the climate,9
Tom Steyer, so let me say this im the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority i would not sign this deal because if climate is your number one priority you cant sign a deal even if its marginally better for working people until climate is also taken into consideration,9
Tom Steyer, look ive got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31 i cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction everybody in their generation knows it frankly mayor buttigieg youre their generation id think you would be standing up more look thats why im standing up for it we cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say were going to sign this one more deal were going to do one more thing without putting climate first thats why its my number one priority we can do it in a way that makes us richer but we have to do it,9
Moderator 1, mayor buttigieg your response,9
Pete Buttigieg, well thats right this issues personal for me thats why were going to tackle climate from day one its why weve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today,9
Pete Buttigieg, now what ive noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century starting with actions that we take right now the question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades,9
Pete Buttigieg, the other day in winterset there was a kid at one of my events raised his hand and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties in the year 2100 he will sit in judgment over what we do not just what we on this stage do anyone old enough to vote right now whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals to act aggressively not just rejoining the paris climate accord thats table stakes but to actually move on from the fossildependent economy we live in today,9
Moderator 2, lets now turn to an issue thats come up in the last 48 hours senator sanders seen and reported yesterday that  senator sanders senator warren confirmed in a statement that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election why did you say that,9
Bernie Sanders, well as a matter of fact i didnt say it and i dont want to waste a whole lot of time on this because this is what donald trump and maybe some of the media want anybody that knows me knows that its in comprehensible that i would think that a woman could not be president of the united states go to youtube today theres a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the united states,9
Bernie Sanders, in 2015 i deferred in fact to senate warren there was a movement to draft senator warren to run for president and you know what i stayed back senator warren decided not to run and i did run afterwards,9
Bernie Sanders, hillary clinton won the popular vote by three million votes how could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the united states let me be very clear if any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination  i hope thats not the case i hope its me but if they do i will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country,9
Moderator 2, so senator sanders senator sanders i do want to be clear here youre saying that you never told senator warren that a woman could not win the election,9
Bernie Sanders, that is correct,9
Moderator 2, senator warren what did you think when senator sanders told you a woman could not win the election,9
E. Warren, i disagreed bernie is my friend and i am not here to try to fight with bernie but look this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and its time for us to attack it headon i think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at peoples winning record,9
E. Warren, so can a woman beat donald trump look at the men on this stage collectively they have lost ten elections the only people on this stage who have won every single election that theyve been in are the women the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican anytime in the past 30 years is me and heres what i know the real danger that we face as democrats is picking a candidate who cant pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the democratic constituency,9
E. Warren, we need a candidate who will excite all parts of the democratic party bring everyone in and give everyone a democrat to believe in thats my plan and that is why im going to win,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar what do you say ,9
Amy Klobuchar, thank you elizabeth,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar what do you say ,9
Amy Klobuchar, i would like to ,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar let me finish my question,9
Amy Klobuchar, oh okay,9
Moderator 2, what do you say to people who ,9
Amy Klobuchar, i thought it was such an open end i wasnt at the meeting so i cant comment but i was going to say ,9
Moderator 2, what do you say to people who say that a woman cant win this election,9
Amy Klobuchar, i hear that people have said it thats why ive addressed it from this stage i point out that you dont have to be the tallest person in the room james madison was five foot four you dont have to be the skinniest person in the room you dont have to be the loudest person you have to be competent,9
Amy Klobuchar, when you look at the facts michigan has a woman governor right now and she beat a republican gretchen whitmer kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat kris kobach her name is  im very proud to know her and her name is governor kelly thank you,9
Amy Klobuchar, third i would add to this you have to be competent to win and you have to know what youre doing when you look at what i have done i have won every race every place every time i have one in the reddest of districts i have won in the suburban areas in the rural areas i have brought people with me that is why i have the most endorsements of current iowa legislators and former iowa legislators in this race ,9
Moderator 2, thank you,9
Amy Klobuchar,  because i know i bring people with me,9
Moderator 2, thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, finally every single person that i have beaten my republican opponents have gotten out of politics for good i think that sounds pretty good i think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the white house right now,9
Moderator 2, senator sanders you can respond,9
Bernie Sanders, well just to set the record straight i defeated an incumbent republican running for congress,9
E. Warren, when,9
Bernie Sanders, 1990 thats how i won beat a republican congressman number two of course ,9
E. Warren, 30 years ago,9
Bernie Sanders,  i dont think theres any debate on ,9
E. Warren, wasnt that 30 years ago,9
Bernie Sanders, i beat an incumbent republican congressman,9
E. Warren, i said i was the only one who has beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years,9
Bernie Sanders, well 30 years ago is 1990 as a matter of fact but i dont know that thats the major issue of the day i think what the major issue of the day is  does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected president thats enough nobody believes that hillary clinton got 3 million votes more votes than trump so who believes that a woman cant win of course a woman can win,9
Bernie Sanders, but the real question is how do we beat trump the only way we beat trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has by far the largest voter turnout in the history of this country,9
Bernie Sanders, i believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement,9
Moderator 2, thank you,9
Bernie Sanders, we are endorsed by many grassroots organizations,9
Moderator 2, senator warren senator warren i want to give you the final word,9
E. Warren, so i do think its the right question how do we beat trump heres the thing since donald trump was elected women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races in 2018 we took back the house we took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters,9
E. Warren, look dont deny that the question is there back in the 1960s people asked could a catholic win back in 2008 people asked if an african american could win both times the democratic party stepped up and said yes got behind their candidate and we changed america thats who we are,9
Moderator 2, vice president biden vice president biden go ahead,9
Joe Biden, i agree women can win and ive went in and campaigned for 27 of them this last in 2018 the best group ive ever campaigned for in terms of competence but the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party african americans brown black women men gay straight the fact of the matter is that i would argue that in terms of endorsements around the country endorsements wherever we go i am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race,9
Moderator 2, all right were going to take a short break now the cnn democratic presidential debate live from drake university will be right back lets turn to healthcare the top issue for iowa democrats donald trump is trying to repeal obamacare including the protections for preexisting conditions we all know that each of you vigorously opposes that still there are some questions about what each of you would do,9
Moderator 2, senator sanders youve consistently refused to say exactly how much your medicare for all plan is going to cost dont voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars,9
Bernie Sanders, well what i will tell you is medicare for all which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man woman and child will cost substantially less than the status quo medicare for all will end the absurdity of the united states paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general,9
Bernie Sanders, while we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30000 people die each year on the medicare for all one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4 tax on income exempting the first 29000 so the average family in america that today makes 60000 would pay 1200 a year compared to that family paying 12000 a year we save money comprehensive healthcare because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system,9
Moderator 2, vice president biden does senator sanders owe voters a price tag on his healthcare plan,9
Joe Biden, i think we need to be candid with voters i think we have to tell them what were going to do and what its going to cost and a 4 tax on income over 24000 doesnt even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as 40 trillion over ten years thats doubling the entire federal budget per year,9
Joe Biden, theres a way to do that the way to do that is to take obamacare reinstate rebuild it provide a public option allow medicare for those folks who want it and in fact make sure that we in the process reduce the costs of drug prices reduce the cost of being able to buy into the  subsidize it further and make it available to everyone heres the deal that costs a lot of money that cost 740 billion over ten years i lay out how i pay for that,9
Moderator 2, senator sanders,9
Bernie Sanders, well first of all what joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is what you are talking about all workers paying on average 20 of their incomes for healthcare that is insane youve got 500000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills were spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country,9
Bernie Sanders, look weve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry of the drug companies and finally provide healthcare to all through a medicare for all single payer program it wont be easy but that is what we have to do,9
Moderator 2, vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, you can do it without medicare for all you can get the same place,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar your response,9
Amy Klobuchar, yeah senator sanders and i have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long long time and we agree on this but what i dont agree with is his position on healthcare this debate isnt real i was in vegas the other day and someone said dont put your chips on a number on the wheel that isnt even on the wheel thats the problem,9
Amy Klobuchar, over two thirds of the democrats in the us senate are not on the bill that you and senator warren are on you have numerous governors that are democratic that dont support this you have numerous house members that put nancy pelosi in a speaker,9
Amy Klobuchar, the answer is a nonprofit public option the answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health i have a plan for that and then finally what should we do about longterm care the elephant that doesnt even fit in this room we need to make it easier for people to get longterm care insurance we need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums,9
Amy Klobuchar, my own dad i know when his longterm care insurance ends and then we have some savings for him hes in assisted living he got married three times whole nother story so there isnt much there but then we go to medicaid and ive already talked to catholic elder care theyre willing to take him in,9
Amy Klobuchar, our story is better than so many other families we have to make it easier for longterm care,9
Moderator 2, thank you thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, its not just for senators its also for the sandwich generation ,9
Moderator 2, thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar,  people trying to help their parents,9
Moderator 2, senator warren,9
E. Warren, so we need to start with whats happening in america people are suffering ill just pick one 36 million people last year went to the doctor got a prescription this is what they needed to get well and they couldnt afford to have the prescription filled they looked at it and said its either groceries or this prescription,9
E. Warren, my approach to this is weve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible i have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime,9
E. Warren, what i can do are the things that i can do as president on the first day we can cut the cost of prescription drugs ill use the power thats already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and epipens and hivaids drugs lets get some relief to those families and i will defend the affordable care act,9
E. Warren, ive got a plan to expand healthcare but lets keep in mind when we come to a general election we democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare but were going to be up against a republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that ill take our side of the argument any day were going to beat him on this,9
Moderator 2, thank you thank you senator warren vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, the  my layout does in fact limit drug costs it allows all the drug companies to  excuse me it allows medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price its sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation by the way theres mental health parity that i call for in the obamacare expanded with the biden option,9
Moderator 2, mr steyer,9
Tom Steyer, look weve had this conversation on this stage so many times everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single american everybody on this stage knows that americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world it makes no sense and the government has to step in,9
Tom Steyer, i do happen to agree with vice president biden that we should move and develop the affordable care act with a public option but the real question is this this is not a new problem why do we keep having this conversation we have a broken government it has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies the insurance companies and the private hospitals,9
Tom Steyer, thats what im talking about how do we get back government of by and for the people how do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed,9
Moderator 2, thank you thank you mr steyer thank you mr steyer senator sanders your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade an unprecedented level of spending not seen since world war ii how would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country,9
Bernie Sanders, no our plan wouldnt bankrupt the country in fact it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class let us be clear what medicare for all does it ends all premiums it ends all copayments it ends the absurdity of deductibles it ends outofpocket expenses it takes on the pharmaceutical industry which in some cases charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here,9
Bernie Sanders, what we will do through a medicare for all single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the 500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans,9
Bernie Sanders, healthcare is a human right every other major country on earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all the time is long overdue for us to do the same,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, again i think it is much better to build on the affordable care act and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream you have to show how youre going to pay for it,9
Amy Klobuchar, i would also note practically that the affordable care act right now is ten points more popular than the president of the united states so i think the answer is to build on it and yes i think you should show how youre going to pay for things bernie i do this president is  people out theyre like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,9
Amy Klobuchar, the way he is adding to our debt i am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit,9
Moderator 2, thank you thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, i have shown how im going to pay for every single plan capital gains thats going to the personal level ,9
Moderator 2, thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar,  getting rid of the oil giveaways ,9
Moderator 2, lets move on,9
Amy Klobuchar,  doing something about the hedge fund loophole you can go through and you can get the money to pay for things,9
Moderator 2, senator klobuchar your time is up lets move on to the next question mayor buttigieg youre selling your plan as medicare for all who want it yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured americans into a public option even if they dont want it and force them to pay for it how is that truth in advertising,9
Pete Buttigieg, well its making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured american look the individual mandate was an important part of the aca because the system doesnt work if there are free riders,9
Pete Buttigieg, what im offering is a choice you dont have to be in my plan if theres another plan that you would rather keep and theres no need to kick americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all my plan is paid for look our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit weve got a dramatically better track record on it than republicans do in my lifetime its almost invariably republican presidents who have added to the deficit 1 trillion under this president,9
Pete Buttigieg, its why everything ive put forward from medicare for all who want it to the historic investments were going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for what comes to healthcare you can do it in two moves of course my plan costs 15 trillion over a decade no small sum but not the 20 30 40 that were hearing about from the others,9
Pete Buttigieg, all ive got to do is two things both of them are common sense allow medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations,9
Pete Buttigieg, roll back the trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didnt even need it,9
Abby P, senator warren,9
E. Warren, so i started this by talking about 36 million americans including americans with insurance who just cant even afford to have a prescription filled we all talk about plans healthcare plans that we have and these plans are paid for the problem is that plans like the mayors and like the vice presidents is that they are an improvement they are an improvement over where we are right now not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who cant afford to get them filled what we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from we can ask those at the very top the top 1 to pay a little more those giant corporations like chevron and amazon who paid nothing in taxes we can have them pay and we can go after the corporate tax cheats and when we do that we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people,9
E. Warren, tax cheats and when we do that we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people yes we build on the affordable care act but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them,9
Abby P, mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, its just not true that the plan im proposing is small weve got to move past a washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many americans it can alienate this would be a game changer this would be the biggest thing weve done to american healthcare in a half century,9
Pete Buttigieg, lets measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes were taking on costs on prescription drugs well have an outofpocket cap even if you dont get the subsidies that would make it free a 250 monthly cap and heres why its got to be monthly you ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that theyve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your outofpocket cap hits it makes no sense medically because most of us dont experience the economy on an annual basis our bills dont come in every year they come in every month same with our paychecks biweekly or monthly thats why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20 30 40 trillion bills,9
Abby P, senator warren your response,9
E. Warren, look the numbers that the mayors offering just dont add up the average family in america last year paid 12000 in some combination of deductibles and copays and uncovered expenses and fees you cant cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about the way we have to approach this is weve got to build this and weve got to build the alliances to make this happen i can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs we can get help to families but we have to be willing to work together,9
E. Warren, we can let people experience what healthcare is like when its you and your doctor your mental health professional your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle  when people try it and use it then,9
Abby P, thank you senator warren senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, senator warren you acknowledged that medicare for all that you couldnt get there right away you got on the bill that said on page eight which is why i didnt get on it that you would kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance then a few months ago you said no youre going to wait a while to get there and i think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what were talking about is true and i dont buy that its not enough it is a big big step to say to people making 100000 a year that your premiums will be cut in half which is what the nonprofit public option will do and if you talk mayor buttigieg about medicare and having negotiation i actually have led that bill for years i have 34 cosponsors as president i can get it done that would allow medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they cant negotiate for better prices for our seniors i will it done,9
Abby P, senator sanders coming to you now cnn reached out to iowa democratic voters for their most pressing questions edward from here in des moines writes des moines is an insurance town what happens to all the health insurance industry here if there is medicare for all what happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like des moines,9
Bernie Sanders, we build into our medicare for all program a transition fund of many many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people but here is the issue tom steyer made the point a moment ago we are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country that is insane in some cases 10 times more for prescription drugs why is that why is that and the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies and if we want to do what every other major country on earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right not a privilege you know what we have to do we are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry,9
Tom Steyer, can i respond to this,9
Bernie Sanders, and end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering,9
Abby P, mr steyer,9
Tom Steyer, i just want to emphasize what senator sanders said this is not a complicated problem between what senator warren and senator sanders said its clear there are two problems were spending way too much because corporations own the system and were not negotiating against those corporations and weve given tax cuts to the richest americans and the biggest corporations for decades thats all this is we have corporations who are having their way with the american people and people are suffering senator warren is right this is cruelty for money in order to break this were going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem thats why im for term limits we need to redo washington dc  and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it,9
Abby P, thank you mr steyer vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, i would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five democratic presidents couldnt get done and that is pass obamacare it was a big deal secondly i would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices you dont have to pay the price limit what they can charge if in fact they charge more than we set the price for in fact people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe we in fact its only yellow okay and we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers if they dont like it or the employer gets rid of it they can buy into a medicare plan in the biden plan,9
Wolf Blitzer, lets talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now prescription drug prices in 2018 americans spent 335 billion on prescription drugs alone thats about 60 billion more than they paid a decade ago senator warren youve called for the creation of a governmentrun drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike why does it make sense for the government to manufacture drugs especially when public trust in government is near historic lows,9
E. Warren, so lets do this both ways what i also have said is im just going to use the power that is available and i will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs i will lower the price of insulin we already have the legal authority with the president to do that president just hasnt picked up and used it i will lower the price of epipens of hivaids drugs thats going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately but you know there are a whole lot of drugs about 90 of drugs that are not under patent theyre generic drugs but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up so my view is lets give them a little competition,9
E. Warren, the government lets contracts for all kinds of things they let contracts to build buildings they let contracts to build military weapons lets let the contracts out put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices this is a way to make markets work not to try to move away from the market you dont have to even use price controls the whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator klobuchar do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs,9
Amy Klobuchar, i am open to looking at it but i would try these things first number one i mentioned the medicare negotiation number two i have a plan 137 things ive found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without congress that are legal and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries bernie and i had an amendment on this we got 14 republican votes on it it was at midnight they mightve not known what they were voting for but we got that i now have an actual bill with senator grassley that does that and i have a bill to get at what elizabeth was talking about which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market the issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of congress,9
Brianne P, thank you senator,9
Amy Klobuchar, they think they own washington they dont own me and as president i will get this done,9
Brianne P, thank you senator klobuchar were going to turn now to childcare a huge expense for many new families and a problem thats especially acute in rural iowa we have another question from an iowa democratic voter mayor buttigieg this is for you tiffany from clive writes as a young mom i had to quit a job i love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income many families dont have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed that leads to families using whatever care they can find and sometimes the results are deadly as weve seen in iowa over the last few years how will you prioritize accessing quality affordable childcare in your first 100 days in office,9
Pete Buttigieg, it makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebodys income weve got to drive it to 7 or below and zero for those families who are living in poverty but this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum i meet professionals who sometimes say that theyre working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working it makes no sense and it must change and we shouldnt be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large we can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebodys like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career,9
Brianne P, senator warren your education plan includes tuitionfree public college for all but you impose an income limit for free childcare why do your plans cover everyone for public college but not childcare and early learning,9
E. Warren, no actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone it just has some people adding a small payment but understand this about the plan ive been there you know i remember when i was a young mom i had two little kids and i had my first real university teaching job it was hard work i was excited but it was childcare that nearly brought me down we went through one childcare after another and it just didnt work,9
E. Warren, if i hadnt been saved by my aunt bee i was ready to quit my job and i think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on how many of my daughters generation get knocked off the track and dont get back on how many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on,9
E. Warren, i have a twocent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal prek for every threeyearold and fouryearold in america and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work largely black and brown women we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america thats an investment in our babies thats an investment in their mamas and their daddies and its an investment in our teachers and in our economy,9
Brianne P, senator sanders will your universal,9
E. Warren, its what we need to do,9
Brianne P, child care program be free for everyone regardless of income,9
Bernie Sanders, yeah let me just pick up on this childcare thing every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life intellectually and emotionally and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment it is unaffordable childcare workers are making wages lower than mcdonalds workers we need to fundamentally change priorities in america we should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal high quality affordable childcare we should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right we should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry tax breaks for billionaires and then to tell the moms and dads in this country we cannot have  highquality affordable childcare that is wrong,9
Brianne P, vice president biden infant care is more expensive than instate public college tuition in more than half the country do you support free universal infant care,9
Joe Biden, there should be free universal infant care but heres the deal i was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed my two boys i had to raise i was a young senator i just hadnt been sworn in yet and i was making 42000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford but for my family childcare it was beyond my reach to be able to do it and thats why theres several things we do,9
Joe Biden, when i tripled the amount of money for title one schools every child three four and fiveyearsold will in fact have full schooling theyll go to school and after school programs which will release some of the burden secondly i think we should have an 8000 tax credit which would put 7 million women back to work they could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an 8000 tax credit i also believe that we should in fact for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care but bernies right we have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care and i provide for that as well my time is up i know but im not going to go over like everybody,9
Brianne P, mayor buttigieg higher education is another huge expense for families you oppose free public college for all because you dont want to make it free for the kids of millionaires but lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people like libraries and public schools why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities,9
Pete Buttigieg, well its simple we expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade its not the same for college now again i dont want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college and under my plan it wont be matter of fact for the first 80 of americans by income it is free at public colleges but if youre in that top income bracket dont get me wrong i still wish you well i hope you succeed when you go to college i just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else,9
Pete Buttigieg, there is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise and we need to be using that to support everybody whether you go to college or not making sure that americans can thrive investing in infrastructure and something that hasnt come up very much tonight but deserves a lot of attention poverty you know the poor peoples campaign is marching on iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more they are driven by their faith i think because even though in politics were supposed to talk middleclass they know theres no scripture that says as youve done under the middleclass so youve done unto me,9
Pete Buttigieg, we got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference and i dont think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce  taxpayer dollars,9
Brianne P, senator warren,9
E. Warren, so look the way i think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in america we need to ask people with fortunes above 50 million to pay more and that means that the lowliest millionaire that i would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about 19 million in the first year in taxes if he wants to send his kid to public university then im okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here we need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because thats how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it bring down the national debt you do universal child care and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work a lot of mamas who can finish their education we make that investment in universal college weve got  people who would finish an education,9
Brianne P, thank you senator senator klobuchar,9
Abby P, yeah you know i  and then we double the pell grants because were going to need fouryear degrees so the money goes where it should go instead of two rich kids going to college,9
Brianne P, mr steyer as a billionaire should your children have been entitled to free public college,9
Tom Steyer, no and let me say this i was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a yearandahalf ago i believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable unjust and unsupportable and the redistribution of wealth to the richest americans from everyone else has to end and i proposed a wealth tax almost a yearandahalf ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need but i want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because were talking a lot about college,9
Tom Steyer, but in fact if you talk about the poor peoples campaign you have to realize that for the youngest kids they are getting an education thats relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods we need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance so were not legislating inequality for the next generation and so we actually invest in every single kid specifically poor kids specifically black kids specifically brown kids we need to start using the money dramatically more for that,9
Wolf Blitzer, well be back with more from cnns democratic presidential debate live from des moines iowa,9
Wolf Blitzer,  senate launching the third trial of a us president the republicanled senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him vice president biden if youre the nominee is it going to be harder to run against president trump if hes been acquitted and able to claim vindication especially after what he said about your family,9
Joe Biden, its irrelevant theres no choice but for nancy pelosi and the house to move he has in fact committed impeachable offenses whether the senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide and by the way im told that i say we have to unite the country its going to be harder after this trial it may be but look you know i understand how these guys are this republican party theyve gone after savage my surviving son gone after me told lies that your networks and others wont even carry on television because theyre flat out lies and i did my job the question is whether or not he did his job and he hasnt done his job and so it doesnt really matter whether or not hes going after me ive got to be in a position that i think of the american people i cant hold a grudge i have to be able to not only fight but also heal and as president of the united states thats what i will attempt to do not withstanding that were going to be more division after hes defeated by me this next time,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator klobuchar going to be a juror in the trial in the senate thats about to start do you worry president trump will be emboldened by acquittal,9
Amy Klobuchar, no we have a constitutional duty to perform here and when i look at what the issue is its whether or not were going to be able to have witnesses weve asked for only four people as witnesses and if our republican colleagues wont allow those witnesses they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter they may as well make him king and last time i checked our country was founded on this idea that we didnt want to be ruled by a king,9
Amy Klobuchar, and i think the best way to think about this trial and what were facing in this election is a story of a man from primghar iowa his name was joseph welch he came from humble beginnings a son of immigrants he became the army counsel and he was the one that went to the joseph mccarthy hearings and when mccarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs there was only one man everyone that was afraid theyre afraid of being blacklisted joseph welch he stood up and looked at mccarthy and said have you no sense of decency sir have you no sense of decency,9
Amy Klobuchar, this is a decency check on our government this is a patriotism check not only is this trial that,9
Wolf Blitzer, thank you,9
Amy Klobuchar, but also this election and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage i say this to  americans you know this is a decency check on this president,9
Wolf Blitzer, mr steyer youve spent millions and millions of dollars telling the american people that president trump deserves to be impeached will it have been worth it if hes been impeached but not removed from office,9
Tom Steyer, well wolf actually what ive done is to organize a petition drive of eightandahalf million americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office and those eightandahalf million people have called their congress people have emailed their congress people and have actually dragged washington dc to see that in fact this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency,9
Tom Steyer, so if you ask me whether standing up for whats right in america standing up for the american people and our safety standing up for the constitution whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the american people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves if you think that that isnt worth it then you dont share the idea that i do about what americas about standing up for whats right is always worth it wolf and i will never back down from that,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator warren a senate trial is expected to keep you in washington in the weeks leading up to the iowa caucuses here how big of a problem is that for you as youre making your closing pitch to voters here,9
E. Warren, look some things are more important than politics i took an oath to uphold the constitution of the united states of america it says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the united states if we have an impeachment trial i will be there because it is my responsibility but understand this what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the american people and something we should all be talking about is the corruption of this administration thats what lies at the heart of it it is about donald trump putting donald trump first not the american people not the interests of the united states of america not even in helping ukraine defend against russia it is about him helping himself that is what we need to do to win this election we need to draw that distinction and show that as democrats were not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations people who want to help themselves that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people thats why were here,9
Brianne P, lets turn now to the climate crisis here in iowa parts of the state remain underwater after recordbreaking flooding began last spring racking up an estimated 2 billion in damages today many iowans are still displaced from their homes mayor buttigieg youve talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding but what do you do about farms and factories that simply cant be moved,9
Pete Buttigieg, thats why we have to fight climate change with such urgency climate change has come to america from coast to coast were seeing it in iowa weve seen it in historic floods in my community i had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a  flood then two years later had to do the same thing in australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place this is no longer theoretical this is no longer off in the future we have got to act yes to adapt to make sure our communities are more resilient to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other but we also have to ensure that we dont allow this to get any worse and if we get it right farmers will be a huge part of the solution we need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them whether were talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community and make clear that we need to enlist them,9
Brianne P, but mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, in the national project to do something about this,9
Brianne P, so clarify what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated,9
Pete Buttigieg, we are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose li,9
Pete Buttigieg,  funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency and by the way that is happening to farms that is happening to factories and that disproportionally happens to black and brown americans which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward,9
Brianne P., thank you mayor buttigieg mr steyer whats your response,9
Tom Steyer, look what youre talking about is whats called managed retreat its basically saying were going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and its unbelievably expensive and of course were going to come to the rescue of americans who are in trouble but this is why climate is my number one priority and im still shocked that im the only person on this stage who will say this i would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate i would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you cant breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely but i also know this were going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country its going to be the biggest job program in american history,9
Tom Steyer, so i know we have to do it i know we can do it and i know that we can to do it in a way that makes us healthier that makes us better paid and is more just but the truth of the matter is were going to have to do it and were going to have to make the whole world come along with us and its going to have to be priority one,9
Brianne P., mr steyer to clarify you say youre the climate change candidate but you made your 16 billion in part by investing in coal oil and gas so are you the right messenger on this topic,9
Tom Steyer, i absolutely am look we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago i realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels that we had to change so i divested from fossil fuels i took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while im alive and for 12 years ive been fighting the climate crisis ive beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws ive stopped fossil fuel plants in oxnard california i fought the keystone pipeline i have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully,9
Brianne P., thank you mr steyer,9
Tom Steyer, so actually yes i am the person here who has the chops and the history that says ill make it priority one because ive been doing it for a long time,9
Brianne P., thank you mr steyer senator warren president trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipelines and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president cant overturn,9
E. Warren, yes climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated i will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day i will roll back the environmental changes that donald trump is putting in place i will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling thatll help us get in the right directions ill bring in the farmers farmers can be part of the climate solution we should see this though for the problem it is mr steyer talks about it being problem number one understand this we have known about this climate crisis for decades back in the 1990s we were calling it global warming but we knew what it was democrats and republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem,9
E. Warren, but you know what happened the industry came in and said we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption that is the only way we will make progress on climate on gun safety on healthcare on all of the issues,9
Brianne P., thank senator warren,9
E. Warren, that matter to us,9
Brianne P., senator klobuchar some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all out ban on fracking you havent why not,9
Amy Klobuchar, well first of all i would note that i have a 100 rating from the league of conservation voters and that is because i have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration this trump administration trying to reverse environmental protections i think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasnt been raised by the way is the rules on methane which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on and i would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones,9
Amy Klobuchar, when it comes to the issue of fracking i actually see natural gas as a transition fuel its a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050 to get to by 2030 do a 45 reduction and i want to add one thing that no ones really answered when we do this we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon which we will do either through cap and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon,9
Brianne P., thank you senator klobuchar,9
Amy Klobuchar, then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people that will be hurt by it  to help with their energy bills and to bring jobs to areas that will lose jobs,9
Brianne P., senator sanders,9
Bernie Sanders, thank you lets be clear if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel not by 2050 not by 2040 but unless we lead the world right now not easy stuff the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy we are seeing australia burning we saw california burning the drought here in iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need this is of course a national crisis ive introduced legislation to indicate its an actual crisis we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet thats what the green new deal does thats what my legislation does and that is what we have to do,9
Brianne P., vice president biden your response,9
Joe Biden, my response is back in 1986 i introduced the first climate change bill and check politifacts they said it was a game changer ive been fighting this for a long time i headed up the recovery act which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of america look what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately if im elected president ill reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration which were taken down thats 12 billion gallons of gasoline barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately and with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by whats already happened we should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads makes sure that were in a position where we have  every new highway build is a green highway  550000 charging stations,9
Joe Biden, we can create and this is where i agree with tom we can create millions of good paying jobs were the only country in the world thats ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity and one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in iowa by making them the first group in the world to get to netzero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away theres more to say but i know,9
Abby Phillips, a key part of your mission in this primary is going to be to prove to democratic voters that youre strong enough to take on donald trump each of you face unique challenges in doing that mayor buttigieg you say youve had trouble earning the support of black voters because youre unknown but youve been campaigning for a year now and polling shows you with next to no black support support that youll need in order to beat donald trump is it possible that black voters have gotten to know you and have simply decided to choose another candidate,9
Pete Buttigieg, the black voters who know me best are supporting me thats why i have the most support in south bend its why among elected black officials in my community who have gotten into this race by far most of them are supporting me and now nationally i am proud that my campaign has cochaired by a member of the congressional black caucus and to have support right here in iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders from mayor hart of waterloo to former representative berry in black hawk county now the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and i never will the reason i have the support i do is not because any voter thinks that im perfect its because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can,9
Pete Buttigieg, not from the luxury of a of a debate or a television panel or a committee room but on the ground issues from poverty to justice in policing and im proud to say weve been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice that we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing of course there is a much longer way to go in my community and around the country but i will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work,9
Abby Phillips, senator sanders you call yourself a democratic socialist but more than two thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist doesnt that put your chances of beating donald trump at risk,9
Bernie Sanders, nope not at all and that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who donald trump is donald trump is corrupt he is a pathological liar and he is a fraud now when trump talks about socialism what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry donald trump as a businessman received 800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing my democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right were going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour were going to make public colleges and universities tuition free were going to have a green new deal and create up to 20 million saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren we are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company that is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election,9
Abby Phillips, mr steyer youve spent more than 100 million of your own dollars on television ads how do you convince voters that youre more than just your money,9
Tom Steyer, look we know how donald trump is going to run for president hes going to run on the economy hes already told americans last month in florida you dont like me and i dont like you but youre all going to vote for me because the democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control so lets be clear i started a business by myself in one room i didnt inherit a penny from my parents i spent 30 years building that business into a multibillion dollar international business then i walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary americans to take on unchecked corporate power but whoever is going to beat mr trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and i have the experience and the expertise to show that hes a  and a fraud look mayor pete has three years as an analyst at mckinsey i have 30 years of international business experience i can beat trump on the economy were going to have to beat him on the economy and i look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage,9
Abby Phillips, mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, you demoted me i was actually an associate but thats okay it was not the biggest part of my career but i am ready to take on this president on the economy because i am from the exact kind of industrial midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation when at the beginning of the decade i took office we were described as a dying city im ready to take on donald trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping hell have to stand next to an american war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve,9
Pete Buttigieg, and if and if he keeps trying to use religion  if a guy like donald trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit christianity into the gop i will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that god does not belong to a political party i am ready to take on this president on every front,9
Abby Phillips, thank you senator klobuchar youre pitching yourself as a practical candidate who can get things done and even tonight youve dismissed some of the ideas that are offered in this primary as pipe dreams how are you going to inspire democratic voters with a message of pragmatism,9
Amy Klobuchar, our voters actually all americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has i think told over 15000 lies he is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric and i think what americans want is something different i am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in iowa the midwest is not flyover country for me i live here im going to be able to look at him and say youve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips for me these are my friends and these are my neighbors im going to be able to look at him and say you know what you got 413 million over the course of your career thats how you built your fortune,9
Amy Klobuchar, and what im going to say is this my grandpa worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college thats my family trust and when you have been given an opportunity like that you go into the world not with the sense of entitlement donald trump but with a sense of obligation,9
Abby Phillips, thank you senator warren what do you say to voters who like your policies but theyre worried they will scare away swing voters you need to win this race in november,9
E. Warren, so i was born and raised in oklahoma i have three older brothers who are all retired who are all back there still and two of my three brothers are republicans and sure there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the democratic republican talking points but the truth is theres a whole lot we agree on you know my brothers just furious over chevron and eli lilly and amazon that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes  make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes my brother said i dont get this i have to pay my taxes somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense,9
E. Warren, they understand that we have an america right now thats working great for those at the top its just not working for anyone else we have a chance to unite unite as democrats but also with independents and republicans who are sick of living in a country thats working great for the politicians that are taking the money its working great for the lobbyists its working great for the corporate executives its just not working for everyone else im building the grassroots movement leading the fight were going to make this america work for everyone else that is how were going to beat donald trump,9
Abby Phillips, vice president biden the eventual nominee will face president trump who has no problem mocking people using insulting nicknames slinging mud and telling lies the debate against him will make tonights debate look like childs play are you prepared for that,9
Joe Biden, i am prepared for that look ive been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage ive taken all the hits he can deliver and im getting better in the polls my going up and by the way i have overwhelming support from the african american community overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation number one number two working class people where i come from in pennsylvania and the places i come from in delaware i have great support i have support across the board and im not worried about taking on donald trump at all and with regard to the economy i can hardly wait to have that debate with him where i come from the neighborhoods i come from theyre in real trouble working class people and middle class people when the middle class does well working class has a way up and the wealthy do well but whats happening now theyre being clobbered theyre being killed,9
Joe Biden, they now have a situation where if they  the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that theyve reached an economic security i love that debate because the american public is getting clobbered the wealthy are the only ones doing well period im looking forward to the economic debate,9
Wolf Blitzer, well be right back with more from cnns democratic presidential debate live from des moines iowa stay right here,9
Wolf Blitzer,  iowa time now for closing statements you each have one minute senator klobuchar lets begin with you,9
Amy Klobuchar, donald trump thinks this is all about him i think its about you its not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego it is about your healthcare it is about your schools it is about your lives and your future so if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her i have won every race every place every time i have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when ive led the ticket i have passed more bills as the lead democrat than anyone whos in congress thats running for president i believe that we need a president thats going to look out for you it is easy to hurl insults it is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day,9
Amy Klobuchar, what is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth what is hard is the work of governing so if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me join me at amyklobucharcom,9
Wolf Blitzer, mr steyer,9
Tom Steyer, i know that iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and i want to tell you how i feel about the american people look i played team sports my entire life the bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as im concerned the american people are my teammates and if theres one thing i will not permit it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face and that is exactly what ive seen over the last seven years traveling around this country seeing these republicans led by mr trump basically kicking the american people in the face i am prepared to take on mr trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy but i am asking for your support because i know that if im going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise i need the support of you on caucus night so i can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world,9
Wolf Blitzer, mayor buttigieg,9
Pete Buttigieg, this is our moment this is our one shot to defeat donald trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send trumpism into the dustbin of history too well we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point if you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction im asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics youre seeing the president boast about the dow jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table join me if youre a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual join me if youre used to voting for the other party but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them join me,9
Pete Buttigieg, we have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past that is why i am running for president it is why im asking you to caucus for me on february 3rd and i hope that you will go to peteforamericacom and join me in this effort,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator warren,9
E. Warren, so much is broken in this country i sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didnt get to talk about tonight how the disability community is struggling for true equality how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country how children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink how trans women particularly trans women of color are at risk black infant mortality climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities people who are being crushed by student loan debt farmers who are barely holding on people struggling with mental illness and yet i come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and its filled with hope because i see this as our moment in history our moment when no one is left on the sidelines our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country our moment when we build the movement to make real change hope and courage that is how i will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the united states of america,9
Wolf Blitzer, senator sanders,9
Bernie Sanders, its been a good debate but we havent asked the major question the major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck trying to get by 9 10 bucks an hour how does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight how does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all how does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional a criminal justice system which is broken and racist an immigration system that needs reform this is the moment when we have got to think big not small this is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us not just the one percent thank you,9
Wolf Blitzer, vice president biden,9
Joe Biden, character is on the ballot this time around the american character is on the ballot not what donald trump is spewing out the hate the xenophobia the racism thats not who we are as a nation everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency its about fundamental basic decency we in the united states of america can put up with  we can overcome four years of donald trump but eight years of donald trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation we have to restore americas soul as ive said from the moment i announced it is in jeopardy under this president of the united states we lead the world when we lead by example not by our power,9
Joe Biden, we in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things ladies and gentlemen we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are this is the united states of america theres not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together lets go do it,9
Wolf Blitzer, candidates thank you very very much that concludes the first democratic presidential debate of 2020 the iowa caucuses are only 20 days away tune into cnn for continuing coverage of this presidential election anderson cooper and chris cuomo pickup our coverage right now,9
George S., candidates welcome vice president biden the first question is for you in the last few days youve been saying that democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate senator sanders or mayor buttigieg but they came out on top in iowa what risks did the iowa democrats miss,10
Joe Biden, oh they didnt miss anything its a long race i took a hit in iowa and ill probably take a hit here traditionally bernie won by 20 points last time and usually its the neighboring senators that do well but no matter what im still in this for the same reason we have to restore the soul of this country bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together and so its a simple proposition it doesnt matter whether its this one or the next ive always viewed the first four encounters two primaries and two caucuses as the starting point and so thats how i view it,10
George S., why are senator sanders and mayor buttigieg too big a risk for democrats,10
Joe Biden, well you know that with regard to senator sanders the president wants very much to sic a label on every candidate were going to not only have to win this time we have to bring along the united states senate and bernies labeled himself not me a democratic socialist i think thats the label that the presidents going to lay on everyone running with bernie if hes a nominee and a mayor buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot hes a mayor of a small city who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to and well soon find out to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum including african americans and latinos,10
George S., senator sanders let me give you the chance to respond first president trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work at the state of the union he said socialism destroys nations hes never going to let socialism destroy american healthcare and before the super bowl he joked was sean hannity about your honeymoon in moscow those hits are going to keep coming if youre the nominee why shouldnt democrats be worried,10
Bernie Sanders, because donald trump lies all the time it doesnt matter what donald trump says its a sad state of affairs it really is he will say terrible things about joe he has  ugly disgusting things about elizabeth about amy about anybody else who was up here but i think george that at the end of the day the way we defeat donald trump and everybody up here by the way is united no matter who wins this damn thing were all going to stand together to defeat donald trump,10
Bernie Sanders, i believe that the way we beat trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country and that is appealing to working class people who have given up on the political process because they dont believe that anybody is hearing their pain perceiving that pain feeling their pain and we got to bring young people into the political process i am very proud that in iowa we won the popular vote by 6000 votes what was most significant most significant is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30 if we do that nationally were going to defeat donald trump,10
George S., but senator let me follow up there and then well move on but back in iowa the turn out this year was about the same as it was in 2016 far below what it was in 2008 when president obama won,10
Bernie Sanders, thats true and thats the disappointment and i think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters but if there is a good spot a good aspect about that campaign is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during obamas historic 2008 campaign and if that happens nationally were going to win and defeat trump,10
George S., before i move on to mayor buttigieg let me just ask is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the democratic ticket,10
Bernie Sanders, im not,10
George S., senator klobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, bernie and i work together all the time but i think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief and i think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her instead of shutting them out and when i look at a state like new hampshire that had a very very close election last time in 2016 i see a state that yes has a high voter turnout firedup democrats just like my state which by the way bernie when i led the ticket had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country but i add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate republicans because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate and truthfully donald trumps worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle the people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense and they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else and i would submit that that is me,10
George S., mr steyer is socialism ,10
Tom Steyer, i dont think theres any question george that after this week theres a real threat that donald trump can get reelected and i dont think theres any question but that the only way that were going to beat him actually is the way that bernie sanders said which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters and that means were going to have to appeal across the spectrum moderates progressives and every group so unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the democratic party including specifically the black community including specifically latinos if you cant do that then we cant beat donald trump in november and we cant choose a candidate who cant do that and i am doing that right now with 24 of blacks down in south carolina with high numbers in nevada thats what its going to take is turnout but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters someone who can pull as amy said everything together in every single way were divided,10
George S., andrew yang and senator warren then mayor buttigieg,10
Andrew Yang, first let me say america its great to be back on the debate stage thank you im so excited i want to give every american 1000 a month george the entire capitalism socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models they did not foresee technology getting stronger more powerful capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye we have record high corporate profits in this country right now but people in new hampshire know what else are at record highs mental illness stress debt substance abuse overdoses suicides what we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our familys way of life instead of following gdp and corporate profits off a cliff we should be measuring our own health and wellness life expectancy mental health and freedom from substance abuse clean air and clean water how our kids are doing the way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our familys lives,10
George S., senator warren you reportedly said back in 2018 im a capitalist to my bones senator sanders says im not is that your biggest difference with senator sanders,10
Elizabeth Warren, oh bernie and i have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on but theres fundamental question about how we bring our party together we have to think about it in new ways people across this country whether theyre democrats independents or republicans understand that weve got a government right now that works great for those at the top works great for giant drug companies just not for people trying to get a prescription filled works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us when you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and its not working so great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out for what it is corruption and thats what we can run on we bring our party together,10
Elizabeth Warren, its an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption were the democrats we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and republicans on that they hate the corruption as well my anticorruption plan good for republicans and democrats thats not only how we bring our party together thats how were going to win in november,10
George S., mayor buttigieg early in the campaign you said that the word socialism has lost its power its mostly lost its meaning do you believe that or worry it could be a potent weapon in a general election,10
Pete Buttigieg, im not interested in the labels im not interested in what republicans are going to say im interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually finally turn the page in order to win yes but also in order to govern this is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadnt even thought of a few years or decades ago and politically were facing a fundamentally new problem with president donald trump so the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says if you dont go all the way to the edge it doesnt count a politics that says its my way or the highway,10
George S., are you talking about senator sanders,10
Pete Buttigieg, yes because weve got to bring as many people as we can into this process look all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that its going to take in order to win but the process of actually proving it is now underway and now it comes to new hampshire a state that thinks for itself is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldnt even be on their side if we dont agree 100 of the time,10
George S., senator sanders your response,10
Bernie Sanders, needless to say ive never said that but let me tell you what i do say the way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country not for the billionaire class the way you bring people together republicans independents democrats progressives conservatives you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour the way you bring people together is to make it clear that were not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations theyre going to start paying their fair share of taxes thats what the american people want and ill tell you something else the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right and you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry theyre not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in canada that borders on new hampshire thats how you bring people together and you defeat donald trump,10
George S., mayor buttigieg you just heard senator sanders make healthcare the center of his piece do you think his healthcare plan can bring people together,10
Pete Buttigieg, i think theres a better way its true the american people are ready theres a historic majority right now even broader than what was available to president obama a decade ago there is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured american and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription just so long as we dont command people to accept a public plan if they dont want to thats the idea of medicare for all who want it my point is what i am offering is campaigning for all of these things that america wants yes higher wages doubling the rate of unionization in this country making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share delivering healthcare and college affordability but also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize not polarize the american people that is not only what we need in order to win its what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done,10
George S., vice president biden how do you unify the country,10
Joe Biden, look bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have medicare for all but bernie says and he says he wrote the damn thing but hes unwilling to sell us with the damn things going to cost the fact that were in new hampshire very levelheaded group of people look at the numbers how much is it going to cost whos going to pay for it it will cost more than the entire the entire federal budget we spend now more than entire budget the idea middle class taxes arent going to go up is just crazy when they did it in vermont what happened they doubled the state income tax and then had a 14 tax on withholding and they finally did away with it so how much is it going to cost when you ask bernie that and ill ask him again tonight sometime and if you ask bernie that he says go figure i dont know well find out,10
Joe Biden, i think that was on cbs he said  well find out or something to that effect imagine youre going to unite the country walking into the congress i got this bill its going to require medicare for everybody i cant tell you how much its going to cost well find out later and its likely to be double whatever  everything we spent in the federal government who do you think is going to get that passed i busted my neck getting obamacare passed getting every democratic vote i know how hard it is,10
George S., senator sanders,10
Bernie Sanders, well for a start what the studies show if we do what joe wants well be spending some 50 trillion on healthcare over the next 10 years thats the status quo joe thats what health and human services says  and what we have got to do joe and what we have got to do is understand simple question joe we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made 100 billion in profit maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting 500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans what medicare for all will do is save the average american substantial sums of money substantial be much less expensive than your plan and we will expand medicare to include dental care eyeglasses hearing aides and home health care as well,10
George S., vice president biden 30 second response then senator klobuchar after that,10
Joe Biden, 30 second,10
George S., yeah 30 second,10
Joe Biden, 30 second response my proposal gives you a choice youre going to be covered you have medicare if you want it you turn  were going to restore all the cuts that they made in obamacare were going to reduce drug prices reduce prescription prices reduce copays et cetera and it cost a lot of money it costs 750 billion over 10 years i tell you how im going to pay for it im going to raise the capital gains rates you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is thatll pay for it thats 800 billion but heres the deal the fact is that its going to cost  bernies plan costs double double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the united states of america,10
George S., senator klobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, i keep listening to this same debate and it is not real it is not real bernie because two thirds of the democrats in the senate are not on your bill and because it would kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years and let me say what else elizabeth wants to do it in two years and pete while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said henceforth forewith indubitably affirmatively you are for medicare for all for the ages and so i would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position looking at things and sticking with them i have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the affordable care act with a nonprofit public option that is the best way to do it,10
Amy Klobuchar, and practically look at this the affordable care act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the president of united states so why would we talk about blowing it up what we need to do is build on it mental health care addiction longterm care those are the things that would make it better for everyone,10
George S., senator warren and mayor buttigieg you were both invoked i want you each to respond and then go back to senator sanders,10
Elizabeth Warren, so i think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is 36 million americans last year couldnt afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance i want everyone in here to think about what that means they were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor a doctor looked at it and says thats serious enough to write a prescription they walked out and then said its either that or groceries its that or pay them rent on time we have got to change our healthcare system the way  help to the most people as quickly as we can how about we start with what a president can do i love saying this all by herself on day one i will defend the affordable care act and i will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and hiv aids drugs and epipens,10
Elizabeth Warren, we can start making healthcare better for americans from the beginning but we have to agree to do that we are the democrats we are on the side of expanding healthcare when we come up against donald trump the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people whats going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country thats who democrats are,10
George S., mayor buttigieg i want you to respond to that but also take on the argument at the beginning from the vice president you dont have the right experience to be president,10
Pete Buttigieg, sure well first of all just to be clear the truth is that i have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every american and as to experience i just bring a different perspective look i freely admit that if youre looking for the person with the most years of washington establishment experience under their belt youve got your candidate and of course its not me the perspective im bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in washington dc somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the situation room we need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past turn the page and bring change to washington before its too late,10
George S., vice president biden theres his answer,10
Joe Biden, the politics of the past i think were not all that bad i wrote the violence against women act i managed the 900 billion recovery act which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city i was able to do it i was able to pass the chemical weapons ban arms control and i was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage so i dont know what about the past of barack obama and joe biden was so bad what happened what is it that he wants to do away with we were just beginning,10
Joe Biden,  happened what is it that he wants to do away with we were just beginning it was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways and theres ways to do that and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done and can lead the free world at the same time,10
George S., mayor buttigieg respond and then senator sanders,10
Pete Buttigieg, those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment but now we have to meet this moment and this moment is different the next president is going to face challenges from global health security like what were seeing coming out of china to cybersecurity and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago and here at home were seeing things like gig work transform what it means to be a worker in america in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago we cannot solve the problems before us by looking back we have to be ready to turn the page and change our politics before its too late and im seeing everywhere i go not just fellow democrats but a striking number of independents and what i like to call future former republicans ready to join in that historic american majority to turn the page,10
George S., senator klobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, i am listening to this about meeting the moment and my first thought is im a fresh face up here for a presidential debate and i figure pete that 59 my age is the new 38 up here the second thing i think about is this and that is,10
Bernie Sanders, 70 is the new 50,10
Amy Klobuchar, okay there you go meeting the moment meeting the moment we had a moment the last few weeks mayor and that moment was these impeachment hearings and there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people there was courage from doug jones our friend of alabama who took that tough vote there was courage from mitt romney who took it very very difficult vote there was courage as i read today about lieutenant colonel vindman being escorted out of the white house what he did took courage but what you said pete as you were campaigning through iowa as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing you said it was exhausting to watch and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons,10
Amy Klobuchar, it is easy to go after washington because thats a popular thing to do it is much harder as i see senator shaheen in the front row such a leader it is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions because i think this going after every single thing that people do because its popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer i just i dont think thats what people want right now we have a newcomer in the white house and look where it got us i think having some experience is a good thing,10
Bernie Sanders, george george can i,10
George S., senator sanders then mayor buttigieg,10
Andrew Yang, george can i say,10
Bernie Sanders, look at the end of the day we got to ask ourselves a very simple question whether its healthcare in fact or anything else why are we the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee healthcare to all people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs have 87 million people uninsured or underinsured 30000 die because they dont get to a doctor on time and 500000 people going bankrupt for what reason because they have cancer or heart disease or alzheimers we got to ask that question why is it why why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years and here is the answer if you want real change in healthcare at the end of the day youre going to have to take on the insurance companies and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all not huge profits for the insurance companies youre going to have to take on the drug companies and their corruption and their price fixing and tell them sorry were not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs than do the people of other country but at the end of the day theres no way around it you may want to nibble around the edges but ultimately you need to rally the american people to tell the drug companies to tell wall street to tell the insurance companies to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us not a handful of special interests,10
George S., mayor buttigieg wrap this up and then,10
Tom Steyer, i have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate and theyre all right everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the republican party and a million times better than donald trump that is not the question in front of us today the question in front of us today is how are we going to beat donald trump you were in the clinton campaign in 1992 and the mantra was its the economy stupid well if you look at what mr trump is saying hes saying those words its the economy stupid i trust every one of these people a million times more but were going to have to take mr trump down on the economy because if you listen to him hes crowing about it every single day and hes going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy stupid and thats the issue here it is not about who has the best healthcare plan all the healthcare plans are better a million times better,10
Tom Steyer, the question is who can go toe to toe with mr trump who can take down mr trump because hes the real threat to the country and let me say you have to have experience to take him down this is not a question of hes a nice guy whos going to listen we need people with experience thats why im worried about mayor pete you need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy and take him down on the debate stage or were going to lose and thats actually the issue in front of democratic voters i have heard this debate so many darn times and i love all these people and theyre all right if we win we can get the right thing bernie i am with you if we win we can get the right thing pete and amy but we got to win or we are in deep trouble and we keep not talking about the facts,10
George S., mayor pete,10
Pete Buttigieg, heres how were going to win were going to force this president to stand on that debate stage next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood in the industrial midwest in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for but turns his back on were going to put up somebody whos not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast and remind americans that god does not belong to a political party were going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn and remind him what serving this country is really about if we want to beat this president weve got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past and unify this country around a new and better vision thats how were going to win and when i talk about exhaustion this is important because i got to tell you the american people from outside of washington we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division and the dysfunction there,10
Pete Buttigieg, and that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of congress and the senate are doing its not but the reason i raise that sense of exhaustion is i see it i see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that ive spoken to in communities from claremont to manchester and in the other states that were in and the important thing for the american people to remember is this is 2020 its an election year and if the senate was the jury before you are the jury now the american people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president and on the senators in the gop who protected him,10
Andrew Yang, pete fundamentally you are missing the lesson of donald trumps victory donald trump is not the cause of all of our problems and were making a mistake when we act like he is,10
Pete Buttigieg, thats right,10
Andrew Yang, he is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades and it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease most americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose i lose you lose i lose for years and you know whos been losing this entire time we have our communities have our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet thats why iowa traditional swing state went to trump by almost 10 points thats why ohio a traditional swing state is now so red that im told were not even going to campaign there,10
Andrew Yang, so these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens weve automated away four million manufacturing jobs and counting were closing 30 of new hampshire stores and malls and amazon the force behind that is literally paying zero in taxes these are the changes that americans are seeing and feeling around us every day and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems we will not just defeat donald trump in the fall but well actually be able to move our communities forward,10
George S., i know were going to hear a lot more on this but were going to move on,10
Speaker 1, thank you george good evening candidates we come to you of course just 48 hours after the acquittal of president trump a process that has certainly crystallized the divide in our country senator warren want to start with you you have said that on day one of your presidency one of your first orders of business will be to order your justice department to launch new investigations into the trump administration after a grueling impeachment and what is likely to be a polarizing election is investigating president trump the best way to try to unify the country,10
Elizabeth Warren, look i think no one is above the law and that includes the president of the united states we watched on wednesday as republicans all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country i believe in an independent commission in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government it is an important part of accountability it is an important part for every administration that we hold ourselves accountable to the american people look people around this country are losing faith in our government theyre losing faith that government works for them they see a government that just works great if youre rich it works great if youre a lobbyist it works great if youre a corporate executive but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less and we could do something about it,10
Elizabeth Warren, its not enough simply to talk about the future we have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government and make that government instead work for us we can do child care in this country for every baby we can invest in our public schools we can cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires return it to the people this is about our government this is about our democracy this is about our future,10
Speaker 1, mr yang you said that the notion of a leader quote throwing the president before them in jail is not the way things are done here in the united states it would make it quote very hard for any party to govern sustainably moving forward does that mean that any alleged misconduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated,10
Andrew Yang, there are of course limits and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office but the fact is if you look around the world the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail have generally been developing countries and unfortunately thats a pattern that once you establish is very very hard to break whats a more american tradition we move the country forward we dont focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office most americans do not care about what a particular individual did so much as they care about their familys wellbeing their community their town thats where americans focus wants they want the american president they want the present of course the american president sorry about that they want the president to be focused on that and thats where our attention should be we should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries,10
Speaker 1, senator sanders,10
Bernie Sanders, along with elizabeth and amy we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process and heres what i think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of trump who in fact committed impeachable offenses and obstructed congress it is the precedent that it set the precedent that it set and what that precedent is about now is in the future youre going to have presidents who say hey governor you want highway money you better support me or youre not going to get it because i am the president i can do anything i want,10
Bernie Sanders, hey congress you want to investigate me dont be ridiculous who cares about the congress who cares about the separation of powers who cares about the constitution of the president im the president of the united states i have all of the power and im able to intimidate members of my own party the saddest aspect of this whole thing is you have republicans in the senate who knew better they knew that donald trump is a crook they knew that donald trump is a cheat but they didnt have the guts with the exception of romney to vote against him that is a sad day,10
Speaker 1, mr steyer,10
Tom Steyer, so i did start the need to impeach movement in october of 2017 and my father was one of the people who prosecuted the nazi war criminals after world war ii and thats part of the reason i started it because when you see something really wrong in the united states youre supposed to stand up against it and fight against it and thats what i was doing but hes been the republicans have rolled over theyve had a sham trial theyve refused to have witnesses theyve covered up the truth for the american people and it doesnt matter anymore that hes a crook and hes always been a crook and he always will be a crook right now what we have to do is we have to beat him in november and we have to beat him because hes incompetent and bad for the american people and thats the case we have to make now,10
Tom Steyer, is he a crook i knew that two years ago is he going to be more of a crook now that he believes he can get away with anything of course he is but the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in november and thats going to be based on what we can deliver for the american people the fact that hes incompetent as a president his economy isnt delivering for working people the jobs dont pay enough for people to live on weve got to take him down on the economy and get them out of the white house as soon as possible,10
Speaker 1, thank you mr steyer impeachment is of course over but republicans in congress have already started investigating vice president bidens son hunter mayor buttigieg do you think that theres a danger for the democratic party to nominate a candidate who is still under the threat of investigation,10
Pete Buttigieg, no and were not going to let them change the subject this is not about hunter biden or vice president biden or any biden this is about an abuse of power by the president the vice president and i and all of us are competing but weve got to draw a line here and to be the kind of president to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father is an unbelievably dishonorable thing that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term,10
Speaker 1, vice president biden,10
Joe Biden, i thank my colleague for saying that it is a diversion but heres the deal whomever the nominee is the presidents going to make up lies about he thinks he has free reign right now one of the things that i think is really important is we have to be authentic with the american people about what were going to do and how were going to do it and by the way colonel vindman got thrown out of the white house walked out i think at the same time he should have been pinning a medal on vindman and not on rush limbaugh and i think we should all stand and give colonel vindman a show of how much we supported him stand up and clap for vindman get up there who we are thats who we are we are not what trump is,10
Speaker 1, thank you vice president biden the democratic partys last presidential nominee hillary clinton has criticized senator bernie sanders track record in the senate,10
Bernie Sanders, i wasnt able to hear that question,10
Speaker 1, okay sure the democratic partys last presidential nominee hillary clinton has criticized senator bernie sanders record in the senate saying nobody likes him nobody wants to work with him he got nothing done senator klobuchar you served with senator sanders in the senate is he going to be able to get the support not if you like him but is he going to be able to get the support that he needs from republicans,10
Amy Klobuchar, i like bernie just fine we actually have worked together on a number of things including pharmaceuticals we actually had a vote late at night one time klobuchar sanders amendment to bring in less,10
Bernie Sanders, i thought it was sandersklobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, nope nope nope it was not it was not to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries since in this great state of new hampshire like in minnesota and vermont we can see canada from our porch and we ended up getting i think 14 republican votes and they might not have noticed what was happening late at night but we got those and i think that it is just an example of what we need to do here because ive been listening to this discussion i agree with my colleagues we must unite but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for america that is what we must do and that means taking on a president if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on,10
Amy Klobuchar, taking on a president that literally went down to maralago after he signed that republican tax bill and looked at all his friends and said you just got a lot richer that is exhibit a for those carpenters in pennsylvania and those dairy farmers in wisconsin and those dock workers that i met with in michigan that is an exhibit a and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country some of whom voted for donald trump that we have something better to offer that we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill and put that money into their childcare into their healththere,10
Speaker 1, senator just a quick yes or no do you think that senator sanders will be able to get republican support in order to pass his bills,10
Amy Klobuchar, that i dont know i know we did on that bill but the point is i think were better off with someone that has the receipts someone that has actually won big time with republicans and independents and im the only one up on this stage you can check it out that has consistently won in red congressional districts not once not twice but three times and when i did this i didnt just do it for me i led a ticket ive flipped the state house every single time because i have a way of working with people that i think should be valued here as we look at these candidates and its one of the reasons that i got the new york times endorsement along with elizabeth and that i got the endorsements of the three major papers here in new hampshire which is the union leader the seacoast papers and the keene sentinel i think that matters read those editorials and you will get a sense of what im about,10
Speaker 1, thank you senator senator sanders,10
Bernie Sanders, i must confess i dont get too many newspaper editorial support must confess that,10
Amy Klobuchar, well you the conway endorsement,10
Bernie Sanders, i did were very proud of that,10
Amy Klobuchar, there we go,10
Bernie Sanders, but let me just say this i think the question started off with secretary clintons critique i think quite honestly as we face one of the great political crises facing america our job is to look forward and not back to 2016 and i hope that secretary clinton and all of us can come together and move in that direction now second of all in terms of republicans let me say,10
Bernie Sanders, in that direction now second of all in terms of republicans let me say that in my own great state of vermont if my memory is correct amy i got 25 of the republican vote and in fact there were periods when i was in the house of representatives a number of years where i passed more amendments on the floor of the house in a bipartisan way than any other member of the house and that is when you bring people together on an issue there are many conservative republicans for example who are concerned about civil liberties at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties there are republicans as you know who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs there are ways that we can work with republicans on issues where we have a common basis,10
Lindsey, thank you senator,10
Bernie Sanders, lets do that,10
Lindsey, david,10
David Muir, lindsey thank you good evening all i want to turn to americas role in the world and readiness to be commanderinchief on day one just this week you saw it during the state of the union president trump offered an indication of what hell tout on the campaign trail he celebrated the us air strike that killed top iranian general qasem soleimani saying soleimani was the iranian regimes most ruthless butcher a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of american service members in iraq,10
David Muir, mayor buttigieg youre the only veteran standing on this stage and while there is still debate about whether or not there was an imminent threat there is no debate about whether or not soleimani was a bad actor who was responsible for the deaths of many americans given what you know about soleimani if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike would soleimani have been dead or would he still be alive under your presidency,10
Pete Buttigieg, in the situation that we saw with president trumps decision there is no evidence that that made our country safer look i feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that general soleimani and his units have perpetrated its also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in iraq its that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing this president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war but it didnt start with the soleimani strike it started with withdrawing us from the iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working and its time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve,10
Pete Buttigieg, by chance just because i was traveling for the campaign not long ago i ran into somebody that i hadnt seen since we were both serving hadnt seen since she was injured in an insider attack and i saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a wounded warrior project tee shirt that said some assembly required and when i asked her how she was doing she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldnt save tapped on the prosthetic and said the navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment,10
Pete Buttigieg, the people in our uniform will do whatever the united states requires of them what they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence pay attention to the international security situation consult with our allies keep us politics out of it and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harms way if there is an alternative,10
David Muir, mayor buttigieg let me just press further on this though because president trump has signal in a general election campaign he will celebrate his willingness to order that strike im asking if your national security team came to you and presented you with the opportunity would you take the strike,10
Pete Buttigieg, it depends on the circumstances it depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be thats my point this is not an episode of 24 this is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture this president has insulted the intelligence community but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified and i dont think he even reads it,10
Pete Buttigieg, and here we have a situation where the world that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to colonel vindman but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor we deserve a better commanderinchief,10
David Muir, mayor buttigieg thank you i do want to take this to vice president biden next because we know that the obama administration was aware of the threat that soleimani posed so was the bush administration before it im asking tonight as commanderinchief though would you have ordered the strike,10
Joe Biden, no and the reason i wouldnt have ordered the strike there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him look what happened his america first policies made america alone you cannot think of a time david and as long as youve been alive when nato has said to the united states of america and to iran made a moral equivalence and said both of you stand down we are alone now alone in that region of the world without friends without support without allies,10
Joe Biden, and secondly you saw what happened when that air raid when those missiles were fired from iran into iraq at alassad airbase 64 of our heroes were wounded i dont know what i wouldve done if my son were still there i would have been so damn angry i dont know what i wouldve done but heres what happened they had received traumatic brain injury what did the president say he said headaches not bad headaches thats all they are this guy doesnt deserve to be commander inchief for one more day,10
David Muir, mr vice president thank you senator sanders you have called this assassinating a government official you would not have ordered the strike,10
Bernie Sanders, right look here is the danger david there are very bad leaders all over the world kim jongun in north korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of asia with nuclear weapons you got mohammad bin salman in saudi arabia who is a terrible murderer who murdered khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body you have putin in russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies you got xi in china who has put a million muslims into concentration camps,10
Bernie Sanders, you cannot go around saying youre a bad guy were going to assassinate you and then youre going to have if that happens youre opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination what we have got to do which trump does not understand is strengthen the state department and our diplomatic capabilities not just the military what we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say you know what let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the un not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of god knows how many lives,10
David Muir, senator sanders thank you this does take me to afghanistan and to americas longest war senator warren you recently said quote we have one general after another in afghanistan who comes in and says weve just turned the corner and then what happens its all the same someone new comes in and says weve just turned the corner you said so many say it were going in circles,10
David Muir, we were on the ground in afghanistan and iraq in recent months and the generals told us that the us needs some us presence on the ground us special forces some presence to go after isis and the terrorists if your commanderinchief would you listen to the generals or do they fall into the category of the generals youve mentioned before,10
Elizabeth Warren, no look i sit on the senate armed services committee so i get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis ive been to afghanistan to iraq ive been to jordan ive been throughout the region ive been there with john mccain ive been there with lindsey graham to ask the hard questions about whats happening to ask our generals to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground and the bottom line is nobody sees a solution to this war nobody can describe what winning looks like all they can describe is endless war,10
Elizabeth Warren, and i realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say yeah well leave our troops there for five more years for 10 more years lindsey graham has said hes willing to leave troops for 100 more years and yet what has all these years of war brought us right now the afghan government controls less than 60 of the land people dont have faith in it its a corrupt government the opium trade is higher than ever,10
Elizabeth Warren, look we sent our troops in and they did their best they were there for us but we need to be there for them and that means not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily it is time to bring our combat troops home it is time to stop this endless war in afghanistan,10
David Muir, senator warren i want to press you on this you just said combat troops,10
Elizabeth Warren, yes,10
David Muir, so if the generals came to you and said we need us special forces some footprint in iraq and afghanistan would you listen would you leave them,10
Elizabeth Warren, so i want to hear the plan not just a we need it now we need it for the next day we need it for the six months and i want to know where our allies are we all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism but that means it cant just be the united states waging endless war that does not make us safer it does not make the region safer it does not make the world safer we should work with our allies in managing terrorism but we need to end this war in afghanistan we cannot wait five more years or 10 more years or until we turn the corner 10 more times we need to bring our combat troops home,10
David Muir, senator warren thank you i want to take this to the vice president because you have said of senator warrens comments before that the united states should get out of the middle east you have said i quite frankly was surprised that i have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy that we should pull all troops out of the middle east is senator warren wrong on this,10
Joe Biden, im not sure what she if she wants to pull all troops out of the middle east but if she does want to put all troops out of the middle east we saw what happens when that happened,10
Joe Biden, i helped put together a 61 nation group to take out isis by putting fewer than 5000 forces along the turkish border to see to it that they and they lost 10000 the kurds lost 10000 lives they defeated isis they ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man i know very well theyve now the guy running turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a democrat and what happened we pulled out and you saw what happened you saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain contain isis number one,10
Joe Biden, number two close your eye everybody remember what you saw on television you saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby kurd saying please dont leave us and our military women and men standing at going out in their  humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did it didnt take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done,10
Joe Biden, and with regard afghanistan now i can say it because it was made public i was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in afghanistan the only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region ive been in every part of afghanistan not in combat like my friend has but in helicopter andor on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president heres what i saw there is no possibility of uniting that country no possibility at all of making it a whole country but it is possible to see to it that theyre not able to launch more attacks from the region on the united states of america thats a small footprint that we needed and i argued for that in the beginning,10
David Muir, you mentioned mayor buttigieg and i do want to take this to you next mayor given your finish in iowa youve come under increasing scrutiny attacks from opponents on experience weve heard that theme even right here tonight you have said on the iraq war for example i just dont believe there is any justification for that vote you said its the difference between tenure and judgment that its the judgment that matters not the time in washington vice president biden as you know voted yes as commanderinchief do you believe your judgment would be better than the vice presidents,10
Pete Buttigieg, i believe that i have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy and looking forward we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before its not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in iraq its about preventing a war with iran and not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that weve been doing throughout the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community,10
Pete Buttigieg, at a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats in president trumps imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators its a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe what we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships but defining a strategy to keep the american people safe from fundamentally new challenges,10
David Muir, mr vice president ill let you respond to his argument on judgment,10
Joe Biden, i made a mistake and i said it 14 years ago i trusted george bush to keep his word he said he was not going to go into iraq he said he was only using this to unite the united nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what saddam was doing when we got elected the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said joe i want you to organize getting 156000 troops out of iraq i did that i did that,10
Joe Biden, the other thing i want to point out too is that nato is in fact going to crumble if we dont beat trump nato is in real trouble we need nato for more reasons than just physical security we need nato to make sure that we do not allow russia to continue to have its influence in eastern europe in ways that it had before it wasnt just to stop the soviet union from coming into the united states coming into europe it was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world to unite europe in our behalf i know how to deal with them i know every one of these world leaders by their first names they call me i talked to them and i believe i can get it done,10
David Muir, mr vice president thank you mr steyer i do want to bring you in on this because i noticed in the last 24 hours you have an attack ad running here in new hampshire with images of mayor buttigieg and you say over those images an untested newcomer but i wanted to ask you tonight on this readiness to be commanderinchief you share the stage with a veteran from afghanistan a vice president who was in the situation room what makes you most qualified of all candidates on this stage to be commanderinchief,10
Tom Steyer, well let me say this i agree with pete buttigieg that its about judgment not tenure what were hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how america should be the worlds policemen and what weve actually seen in the middle east is that barack obama used diplomacy to get iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world so when were talking about our role in the world and commanderinchief we have abandoned a diplomacy we dont have a strategy and we dont have allies,10
Tom Steyer, and actually this view of the world that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world which is climate change and it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes it can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries so in fact what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending 700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend 70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education,10
David Muir, mr steyer ,10
Tom Steyer, lets talk about judgment here ,10
David Muir, mr vice president ill give you 30 seconds to respond,10
Joe Biden, thats not what i said i was part of the reason putting that deal together with iran i was there i was involved in that i was also part of the deal putting together the paris climate accord i brought in the chinese i was part of that ive been part of every major initiative weve had relative to diplomacy i have not argued for the placement of major numbers of us combat troops i have said along with the president of the united states barack obama as his partner i have said we have to strengthen nato to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them like we dont keep our commitments to the kurds we must keep our commitments when we make them otherwise we have no power whatsoever,10
Joe Biden, and its not about making sure were policeman of the world the only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed states and terrorism and it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesnt require large number of us troops and ive never said that,10
Tom Steyer, okay can i respond to that david,10
David Muir, senator sanders senator sanders please,10
Tom Steyer, can i respond to ,10
Bernie Sanders, let me say this if i might like joe and others i also heard the arguments in terms of the war in iraq from bush from cheney from john bolton from the whole administration i listened very carefully and i concluded that they were lying through their teeth and i not only voted against that war but i help lead the opposition and it saddens me so much if you hear what i said its on youtube my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the us invading iraq its sad to me that that is what happened,10
Bernie Sanders, but let me just pick up on a point that tom made which is absolutely right trump wants to build a wall around america the problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change not only do we in america have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry we have to lead the entire world this is not an american issue its a global issue we got to bring china and russia and brazil and pakistan and india and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change,10
Bernie Sanders, and here is my dream maybe its a radical dream but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change the world can understand that instead of spending 18 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change,10
David Muir,  senator sanders thank you george back to you,10
George S., we have much more today coming up but we have got to take a break well be right back,10
George S., welcome back of saint anselm college here in new hampshire and we are here every four years thanks to our amazing manchester partner wmur and now anchor monica hernandez and political director adam section are joining us with questions on the minds of new hampshire voters,10
Monica Hernandez, thank you george its an honor to be here in our community we know granite staters are engaged and we know there are issues that strike especially close to home here new hampshire has one of the highest rates of deadly overdoses in the country in some cases police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again sometimes more than once in a single day its a healthcare issue but its also so much more mayor buttigieg you have described yourself as a moderate but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go you have called for the decriminalization of all drugs does that include heroin meth and cocaine some of the drugs that have contributed to this crisis,10
Pete Buttigieg, no what ive called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession,10
Monica Hernandez, with all due respect mayor buttigieg on your website it says that you called for decriminalization of all drugs,10
Pete Buttigieg, again what im calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response this does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs but also as we know from the opioid crisis some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful its why in south bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable weve got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances even while were also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction,10
Pete Buttigieg, thats why medication assisted treatment is so important and those people who are being revived and our own emts in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody but then they have nowhere to go sometimes you get brought back with a dose of narcan but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country we must act to change that and save lives when we do,10
Monica Hernandez, i want to bring this question now to mr yang youve said you would decriminalize opioids but youve also said that you would require all overdose patients to go to mandatory treatment centers for three days right now in new hampshire there arent enough beds in treatment centers and across the country how would you make sure treatment is available for all overdose patients and what would you do to fill the gap in the meantime,10
Andrew Yang, thats what we have to change monica ive heard heartbreaking stories from families here in new hampshire that have been destroyed torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money as president we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in new hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment you have resources to be able to pursue it,10
Andrew Yang, this is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem but money cannot be the obstacle this is something that happened on the governments watch the government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment you know youre not going to be sent to jail we have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you,10
Andrew Yang, if you have a family member whos struggling you can refer them and know that theyre not going to have criminal penalties as a result there are so much about this thats endemic to whats happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok this hyper corporate capitalism where if moneys on one side in this country and people are on the other side the money is winning you can see it with the opiate epidemic you can see it with the military industrial complex the fossil fuel companies this is what must change and thats where ill lead as president,10
Monica Hernandez, senator klobuchar i want to take the question to you now as a prosecutor you embrace tough on crime policies even with drug offenders youve also spoken many times about your fathers own addiction issues his own alcoholism and his dui arrests if addiction is a disease should people be arrested for it and as a prosecutor do you regret sending people with substance abuse issues to jail,10
Amy Klobuchar, i led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in hennepin county and i always would say and believed and i think my record shows this that we werent a business we didnt want to see repeat customers and if you dont want to see repeat customers the only answer is treatment and maybe youre referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs yes i felt that we should prosecute those people but when it comes to when you asked mr yang a question and i think it we owe it to the people of new hampshire had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed ive been very clear about this,10
Amy Klobuchar, theres going to be a major settlement coming through a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers the evidence is overwhelming including an email where one guy a business guy says to the other theyre eating them like doritos just keep pumping them out we will get a conservative estimate 40 billion in from that settlement we can put a 2 cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another 40 billion then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in 18 billion and just like every other policy ive proposed and i think new hampshire voters should care about this i have showed how im going to pay for it because i think we have someone in the white house that has told over 15000 lies he makes all kinds of promises the people of new hampshire and the people of our country deserve better i will get this done and it is personal for me,10
Adam Sexton, good evening candidates new hampshire is a battleground not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy senator sanders for many voters in this democratic primary your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues youve been on the right side of them for a long time one exception is gun rights in the 90s when you were in congress you voted against background checks you also voted against a waiting period for purchase of a firearm can you explain why you opposed these things that you now support,10
Bernie Sanders, i can adam and let me also say that in 1988 i probably lost a race for congress and we only have one congress person in the whole state because in 1988 i said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country that was 30 years ago furthermore i am very proud that today i have a d voting record from the nra and under my administration it will be the american people doing gun policy not dictated by the nra,10
Bernie Sanders, but to answer your question i come like new hampshire from a very very rural state in vermont until the last two years ago we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and i represented that perspective the world has changed in vermont and in new hampshire and all over this country people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen the world has changed and my views have changed and my view is right now we need universal background checks we end the gun show loophole we end the so called straw man provision we make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country and we go further we go further but at the bottom line is i will not be intimidated by the nra were going to run the gun policy that the american people want,10
Adam Sexton, vice president biden youve taken a lot of heat in this primary on these debate stages and from voters here in new hampshire for your past positions youve essentially asked them to look at the totality of your record and give you the benefit of the doubt does senator sanders deserve that same benefit of the doubt on guns,10
Joe Biden, heres the deal the biggest mistake that bernie made that senator sanders made he voted to give the gun manufacturers the only major industry in america a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating first thing ill do as president is work to get rid of that its going to be hard think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died and i might add bernie while you were representing your constituency an awful lot of people  your gun state and theyve come around in fact all those folks in california new york pennsylvania theyre getting killed by the thousands during the same period,10
Joe Biden, i come from a state thats a major gun owning stare i introduced the first assault weapons ban i in fact got it passed im the only guy that beat the nra twice while i was pushing the brady background bill to check background checks bernie voted five times against that when he was in the house so look the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did im the guy that set up drug courts i set them up i wrote it into law and it never got funded and also on opioids im the guy whos already begun to make a down payment in the cures act i put in 1 billion to fight opioid addiction and lastly my time is going to be up surely heres the deal those chief executive officer of drug companies they should not only be fined they should go to jail,10
Adam Sexton, senator warren wed like to go over to you now  i want to ask you this question here though laws can do so much if you could change one thing about americas gun culture what would it be,10
Elizabeth Warren, look we have a gun violence problem in america it is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us about it in theaters and in churches its also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds often in communities of color that are hit hardest but there are no headlines over those its also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns it is also about the increased chances that its usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home,10
Elizabeth Warren, we need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done we need to think of it just like we did on auto safety we just keep coming back we treat it like the public health emergency that it is but the question we should be asking ourselves is when america across this country including gun owners agree in certain basic things universal background checks get assault weapons off the streets why can we not even get a vote in the united states senate,10
Elizabeth Warren, and the answer is 90 think about this more than 90 of americans agree on this we cant get a vote in the united states senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots until we attack the corruption in washington the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying were not going to be able to meet our promises and one more until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make we have to be willing to build a future that works not for a gun industry but that works for the rest of america and protects our children,10
Joe Biden, we ought to be able to sue the gun industry,10
David Muir, thank you candidates were going to go back to david up there  adam and monica thank you and thanks to wmur tonight i want to turn to the supreme court the balance on the court and the issues before the court right now president trump in just the last 24 hours saying weve appointed 191 federal judges two supreme court justices keeping his campaign promise to shift the court to the right with neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh,10
David Muir, the affordable care act is at the court climate change is working its way to the court and a major abortion case is on the docket this year vice president biden on the issue of abortion in 2012 you said president obamas two supreme court picks of them there was no litmus test we picked people who had an open mind did not come with an agenda and youve said before we both believed that we should not apply narrow litmus tests to appointees to the supreme court let me just ask would you do it differently as president mr vice president would there be a litmus test on abortion,10
Joe Biden, if you say the rest of what i said i said that were going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the constitution thats not a specific test its a generic test and only way the only reason women have the right to choose is because its determined that theres unenumerated rights coming from the ninth amendment in the constitution thats what i said and i was part of the reason why elena kagan who worked for me we got onto the supreme court i was part of the reason why ruth bader ginsburg is on the court i was part of the reason why sotomayer is on the court and she will swear me in i presided and im the reason why this right wasnt taken away a long time ago because i almost single handedly made sure that robert bork did not get on the court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights ,10
David Muir, so let me just,10
Joe Biden, lets get that straight,10
David Muir, mr vice president i am aware of what you said which is why im asking would you do it differently now would there be a litmus test on abortion,10
Joe Biden, yes look heres the deal litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the constitution a woman does have a right to choose i would in fact if they rule it to be unconstitutional i will send to the united states congress and it will pass i believe a bill that excuse me legislates roe v wade adjusted by casey its a womans right to do that period and if you call that a litmus test its a litmus test but what i was talking about in the past so no one gets confused here is if there is no if you read the constitution very very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights if the doesnt say it in the constitution that doesnt exist you cannot have any of the things i care about any of the things i care about as a progressive member of the united states congress at the time and as vice president and as a member of society,10
David Muir, mr vice president thank you senator warren,10
Elizabeth Warren, look ive lived in an america in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and thats what we have to remember about this states are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the supreme court seems headed in exactly that direction as well if we are going to protect the people of the united states of america and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies then its going to mean we cant simply rely on the courts three out of every four people in america believe right now that the rule of roe versus wade should be the law that means we should be pushing for a congressional solution as well it is time to have a national law to protect the right of a womans choice,10
David Muir, senator warren thank you senator klobuchar i do want to come to you should there be a litmus test its an active hall here tonight i did want to come to you on this question,10
Amy Klobuchar, thank you,10
David Muir, should there be a litmus test on abortion,10
Amy Klobuchar, i would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is roe v wade in addition you have got to put it into law donald trump and i think its really important to take it to him here when he was running for election and this is a case i will make on the debate stage against him he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail he then dialed it back and said no i want to put doctors in jail is it a big surprise then were seeing states like alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions its not and that is why its going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding planned parenthood for making sure women have access to contraception to making sure that they have a right to choose that we make this case strongly and loudly,10
David Muir, senator klobuchar thank you mayor buttigieg you have signaled that youd be open to the idea of expanding the court justice ruth bader ginsburg suggested leaving the court as it is saying quote nine seems to be a good number and in fact she said if the number of justices is increased quote it would make the court appear partisan it would be one side saying when were in power were going to enlarge the number of judges to have more people who will vote the way we want them to is justice ginsburg wrong,10
Pete Buttigieg, well if all we did was change the number of justices than i agree with her that that could be the consequence what ive called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process we cannot allow the supreme court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today and the time has come for us to think bigger not just reforming the makeup of the court as america by the way has done several times in our history but also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the constitution for a reason and we shouldnt be afraid to use it,10
Pete Buttigieg, its not something you do lightly or quickly but when it comes to something like citizens united which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an oped to your local paper we need a constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy,10
David Muir, mayor buttigieg thank you vice president biden i do want to come to you on this president trump has said that the only reason democrats want to expand the court is they want to try and catch up you have called any expansion of the court a bad idea adding we will live to rue that day do you agree with president trump on,10
Joe Biden, i agree with ruth bader ginsburg thats who i agree with and i agree the way you deal with citizens united is pass a constitutional amendment i introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections period not private money not billionaires not money from special interests period thats the way to amend the constitution to deal with that in addition to that if in fact look the democrats stood up against the man ive revered franklin delano roosevelt he wanted to expand the court but they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government it says the president shell nominate the senate shall dispose the senate shall make that decision not the president he can nominate,10
Joe Biden, thats why its so important we must win back the united states senate this time out and thats why as you all look at it up here in new hampshire and around the world excuse me around the country you have to ask yourself who is most likely to help get a senator elected in north carolina georgia who can win florida pennsylvania minnesota who can do that because you got to be able to win those well you can i agree but heres the point youve got to be able to youve got to be able to not just win youve got to bring along a united states senate or this becomes moot,10
David Muir, senator sanders ,10
Bernie Sanders, look you asked the simple question is there a litmus test for those of us up here for me there is i will never nominate any person to the supreme court or the federal courts in general who was not 100 pro roe v wade number two we have got a codify roe v wade into legislation number three we have to significantly expand funding for planned parenthood,10
David Muir, mr steyer i want to bring you in on this because you have claimed that when it comes to the supreme court you have said republicans have been cheating,10
Tom Steyer, sure theyve been cheating look what we saw mitch mcconnell do not just in the supreme court with merrick garland but across the board with federal judges was refuse to allow president obamas picks to be considered thats why mr trump has appointed so many federal judges because in fact the republicans refused to allow president obama to get his due and honestly were sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test we all have the litmus test everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a womans right to choose everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control every single one in this row feels the same way,10
Tom Steyer, theres something else going on these republicans are in control theyre stacking the court for a generation with young rightwing radicals and weve watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it thats where we are in the united states and the question is actually joe bidens right we have to go win a huge victory this year and were in trouble and so the question is going to be look at these people who can pull together the democratic party,10
Tom Steyer, and let me say this we have not said one word tonight about race not one word are you kidding me we have the most diverse party we have a very diverse country we have a very diverse party the heart and soul of this party is diversity black people latinos aapi people native americans and white people but for goodness sakes pull it together were talking about something different the question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls what are we saying everybody on this stage feels the same way about a womans right to choose and economic justice the question is how do we beat trump how do we take down these republicans and the answer is weve got to show we can take them down on growth job creation the economy we send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations,10
David Muir, mr steyer thank you the night is still young many questions to come and linsey davis is next,10
Linsey Davis, i want to turn now to criminal justice mayor buttigieg,10
David Muir, linsey davis is next,10
Linsey Davis, i want to turn now to criminal justice mayor buttigieg under your leadership as mayor a black resident in south bend indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident now that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state in fact its higher than the rest of the nation and that disparity increased in south bend after you took office,10
Linsey Davis, when talking about the problem on national terms youve called it evidence of systemic racism you were mayor for eight years so werent you in effect the head of the system and how do explain that increase in black arrests under your leadership,10
Pete Buttigieg, well the reality is on my watch drug arrests in south bend were lower than the national average and specifically to marijuana lower than in indiana but there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system and my city was not immune i took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department but weve got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies,10
Pete Buttigieg, earlier we were talking about opioids and thankfully america has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem but there were a lot of people including a lot of african american activists in my community who have made the very good point its great that everybodys so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids but where were you when it came to marijuana where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s that is one of the reasons why i am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration disproportionately of black and brown americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with,10
Linsey Davis, right let me go back to the original question though how do you explain the increase in black arrests in south bend under your leadership for marijuana possession,10
Pete Buttigieg, and again the overall rate was lower than the national rate,10
Linsey Davis, no there was an increase the year before you were in office it was lower once you became in office in 2012 that number went up in 2018 the last number year that we have record for that number was still up,10
Pete Buttigieg, and one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence which was slaughtering so many in our community burying teenagers disproportionately black teenagers we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder,10
Pete Buttigieg, these things are all connected but thats the point so are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism not just from criminal justice but from our economy from health from housing and from our democracy itself,10
Linsey Davis, senator warren is that a substantial answer from mayor buttigieg,10
Elizabeth Warren, no you have to own up to the fact and its important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system for the exact same crimes study after study now shows that african americans are more likely than whites to be detained to be arrested to be taken to trial to be wrongfully convicted and receive harsher sentences we need to rework our criminal justice system from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system and how we help people come back into the community,10
Elizabeth Warren, but we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically we need to start having raceconscious laws housing for example i have a great housing plan to build more housing in america but understand it was the policy of the united states of america to discriminate against african americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965 you cant just repeal that and say okay now everything is even its not we need raceconscious laws in education and employment in entrepreneurship to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone no matter the color of their skin,10
Andrew Yang, elizabeth with respect you cant regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are racespecific what we have to do is heed the writings of martin luther king whose birthday we just celebrated he said that capitalism forgets that life is social and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all americans of 1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color make it so that black net work is not 10 of white net worth in this country which is the most important number of them all we cant regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of african americans and latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities the only way that will happen is if black and latino consumers have buying power and that is where we have to move as a country,10
Linsey Davis, senator sanders then mr steyer,10
Tom Steyer, let me say this i disagree andrew no let me say this i disagree with you andrew i am the person on this stage who will say openly im for reparations something wrong happened i am for reparations to african americans in this country and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality in fact three days ago one of the leaders of joe bidens south carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign and the legislative black caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign joe im asking you to come with me and the legislative black caucus and disavow dick harpootlian and what he had to say it was wrong and im asking you to join us be on the right side,10
Joe Biden, im asking you to join me and join in the support i have from the overwhelming number of the members of that black caucus i have more support in south carolina in the black caucus and the black community than anybody else double what you have or anybody else here,10
Bernie Sanders, i dont think thats quite right,10
Tom Steyer, but wait a second wait a second bernie,10
Joe Biden, well that is quite right,10
Tom Steyer, lets not argue about polls bernie this isnt about polls,10
Linsey Davis, senator sanders ,10
Joe Biden, this is not about polls im not talking about polls,10
Bernie Sanders, let me just say first of all we have nine members of the black caucus in south carolina supporting us but more importantly much of what elizabeth said is absolutely correct we have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare housing criminal justice education you name it and clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with but in terms of criminal justice what we have got to do is understand the system is broken is racist we invested our young people in jobs and education not more jails and incarceration we end the war on drugs which has disproportionately impacted african americans latinos and native americans we end private prisons and detention centers in america,10
Tom Steyer, bernie i appreciate what youre saying,10
Bernie Sanders, and excuse me we also most people dont know this tonight in america 200000 people are in jail without having been convicted of anything,10
Tom Steyer, thats right,10
Bernie Sanders, 200000 people because they cant afford the 500 for bail they need to get out of jail that is outrageous were going to end cash bail in america,10
Tom Steyer, okay let me say this ive worked bernie ive worked to end cash bail in california and its gone ive worked to end private prisons in california and theyre gone im somebody whos our family my wife and i started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women black people and latinos because they couldnt get financing anywhere else but i joe i want a answer really i think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist that were wrong and the legislative black caucus is against im asking you to join us and do the right thing,10
Joe Biden, ive already spoken to dick harpootlian and he in fact is i believe sorry for what he said but heres the deal folks weve got to stop taking the black community for granted thats the starting place every one of the things we talked about here for example in south carolina jim clyburn he has a program 101530 we should be investing our money in those communities that havent gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities make it a priority we should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense they go directly mandatory prison i mean excuse me mandatory treatment not prison and we fund it and we fund it and three days doesnt get it it takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress we have to pay for that,10
Joe Biden, just like instead of building new prisons we build new rehabilitation centers we have to make sure that we have a window at the treasury department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses you know if you own a house i know you do know if you own a house in an all black neighborhood same exact house in all white neighborhood exact same shape the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth as my friend at the end of the line here says so heres the deal we have to do much much more thats what got me involved in politics in the first place redlining to stop it,10
Joe Biden, i got involved through the civil rights movement i became a public defender thats why i got involved theres so many things we have to do across the board and in education atrisk schools we should triple the funding we have for atrisk schools to provide for three four and five years old to go to school not daycare increase the salaries of teachers encourage more blacks to get into teaching especially black men because studies show when theres a black man in a school it increases prospects significantly and so on theres a lot we can do ive laid it all out as how to do go to joebidencom youll see the whole deal including criminal justice reform,10
Linsey Davis, thank you mr vice president as you mentioned south carolina three weeks from tomorrow theyll go to the polls to vote black voters make up about 60 of the electorate there senator sanders several weeks ago nina turner one of your national cochairs published an oped piece that said vice president biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with republican lawmakers and undermine our progress senator sanders do you agree with her one of your most visible surrogates that vice president biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters,10
Bernie Sanders, well i think what senator turner was talking about are some of the early actions of vice president biden but no joe biden is a friend of mine and im not here to attack him but what i would say is that what we need in terms of the african american community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education in healthcare there is no excuse why white families in america have 10 times more wealth than black families no excuse that disproportionately african americans are in jail compared to whites no excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well,10
Linsey Davis, senator klobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, yes,10
Linsey Davis, you had raised your hand before,10
Amy Klobuchar, yes i did because i think in addition to the economic argument were making here with the sad sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in new orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby and 30 of african american kids being living in poverty we know that there are economic solutions here to invest in those communities housing childcare but theres something else insidious going on that we havent addressed and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting that is moves across the country to limit peoples right to vote and that is why i have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18 there is no reason that we cant do that across this country to stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state and yes to stop the voting purges,10
Amy Klobuchar, because what is going on right now in the words of one north carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against african american voters and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we dont give people the right to vote,10
Linsey Davis, vice president biden and then senator warren,10
Joe Biden, i beg your pardon,10
Linsey Davis, i just wanted to give you a chance to respond,10
Joe Biden, yes i agree completely there should be registration automatic registration turning 18 you get a drivers license whatever you do you automatically are registered number one number two with regard to what were going to see in south carolina were all going to be there pretty soon well see whether or not it works in response to the letter that the person im not saying bernie wrote the letter but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other african americans in south carolina taking issue with her,10
Joe Biden, but look amy is right the senators correct that is that we in fact there is systematic racism and thats why our justice department works so hard to go after those you know realize there are 35 states in the united states of america that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep african americans from voting and brown as well black and brown people from voting and that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours its just wrong simply wrong,10
Elizabeth Warren, im glad to stand on this stage with my fellow democrats who talk about how important the black community is at least at election time year after year after year election after election after election democrats go to people in the black community and say boy we really care about these issues racism is terrible we all want to do something and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse well i think its time we have real concrete plans that are going to make a difference in peoples lives i proposed a two cent wealth tax and let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax we can cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans and because african americans have to borrow more money to go to college borrow more money while theyre in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out that one law is going to help close the blackwhite wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points,10
Elizabeth Warren, we arent making a difference in america were saying to the rich folks you keep your money and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything i think the time for that is over im ready to get in this fight and really make a change,10
Joe Biden, okay thank you,10
George S., actually lets keep this debate going go ahead mr steyer,10
Tom Steyer, out of narrative comes policy and were talking about a lot of policies that affect americans broadly and disproportionately affect black americans or brown americans but what i believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly because everyones saying we cant have rules that are different for different people but in fact were here because we had rules that are different for different people i would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in america of systematic racism against african americans not just legal discrimination injustice and cruelty but also the contribution that the african american community has made to america in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries because i believe out of narrative comes policy we need to repair damage thats been done officially and pretending were all the same is not accurate we got here a certain way lets talk about jim crow lets talk about martin luther king lets talk about barbara lee the congresswoman from oakland whos one of our great leaders and then lets figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together,10
George S., mr yang take on that argument also what he said about reparations,10
Andrew Yang, the median african american household net work is projected to be zero by 2053 things are not getting better for people of color if anything theyre getting wore because were in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy its something of an economic unnatural disaster and who suffers most in a natural disaster people of color people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education,10
Andrew Yang, and while i know we love to champion education here as democrats only 33 of americans are going attend college lower percentage of african americans there is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out african american net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053 and its not just them it is truck drivers it is retail clerks it is call center workers it is accountants it is bookkeepers we are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country and its going to hit black people the hardest we have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem,10
George S., weve been getting a lot of questions from apple news in tonight including many about a candidate whos not on the stage tonight but is in this race and that is former mayor michael bloomberg of new york and this question came in from nashville tennessee says billionaire michael bloomberg has entered the race and just got the endorsement of a former trump navy secretary why do you think you are better positioned than bloomberg to beat trump senator warren,10
Elizabeth Warren, look i dont think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the united states i dont think any billionaire ought to be able to do it and i dont think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it i heard everyone here talking about as democrats we all want to overturn citizens united because we want to end this unlimited spending yeah except everyone on this stage except amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from pacs that can do unlimited spending so if you really want to live where you say then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the pacs,10
Elizabeth Warren, look i think the way we build a democracy going forward is not billionaires reaching in their own pockets or people sucking up to billionaires the way we build it going forward is we have a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up thats the way im running this campaign if you think its the right way to run a campaign to go elizabethwarrencom and pitch in 5 because understand this our democracy hangs in the balance if we have to fund through billionaires then were just going to be an america thats going to work better and better for billionaires and not for anyone else,10
George S., senator klobuchar then senator sanders,10
Amy Klobuchar, so i cant stand the big money in politics and one of my major focuses is going to be on passing that constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united i didnt come from money and i just simply think people dont look at the guy in the white house and say can we get someone richer i dont think they think that they want to have someone that they can understand and you know my background my grandpa was an iron ore miner he worked 1500 feet underground in the mines his whole life he couldnt even graduate from high school because he had to raise his nine brothers and sisters my grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a two year community college that was my familys trust and you cant send like donald trump got from his family you cant fit 413 million in a coffee can,10
Amy Klobuchar, my mom grew up and wanted to be a teacher in wisconsin she moved to minnesota she taught second grade until she was 70 years old and no i am not a billionaire but i stand before you today as granddaughter of an iron ore miner the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman the first woman elected to the us senate from the state of minnesota someone who has passed over 100 bills as a lead democrat in that gridlock in washington dc and that is because we live in a country of shared dreams and that means no matter where you come from no matter where you come from you should be able to make it so please help me in my efforts at amyklobucharcom,10
George S., everybodys getting the fundraising pitches out here,10
Amy Klobuchar, this is a campaign of real people,10
George S., right now senator sanders i am coming to you but mayor bloomberg is,10
Bernie Sanders, lets talk about money and lets talk about,10
George S.,  let me just put the question to you because mayor bloomberg has taken on your argument,10
Bernie Sanders,  ive got to answer before the question its more ,10
George S.,  he says we need evolution not revolution,10
Bernie Sanders, i couldnt hear that,10
George S., mayor bloomberg has said we need evolution not revolution taking you on directly,10
Bernie Sanders, well its a funny thing there are millions of people who can desire to run for office but i guess if youre work 60 billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials you have a slight advantage that is nonsense what we have got to do is have a nation in which we not only overturn citizens united we move to public funding of election,10
Bernie Sanders, in terms of money in politics our campaign and i am enormously proud of this unlike some of the folks up here i dont have 40 billionaires pete contributing to my campaign coming from the pharmaceutical industry coming from wall street and all the big money interests what we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging 1850 a contribution that is unprecedented in the history of american politics if we want to change america youre not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich peoples homes begging for money the way were going to do it is build a mass movement of working people who are prepared to stand up not take money from these billionaires not take money from wall street but stand up to the drug companies and wall street and if you want to be part of that political revolution berniesanderscom,10
George S., mayor buttigieg close this round out,10
Pete Buttigieg, we are going into the fight of our lives donald trump according to news reports and his allies raised 25 million today we need to go into that fight with everything that weve got now ive been very clear on both my record where i have sued pharmaceutical companies and what im campaigning for that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy and as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire i know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of south bend indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse,10
Pete Buttigieg, we are here without the involvement of any corporate pacs because hundreds of thousands of people went to yes peteforamericacom contributed to this campaign and let me say something else if we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat donald trump and in order to do that we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject but how we bring everybody into the fold and if you are lowincome or if youre able to contribute a lot if youve always voted democrat or if youre an independent or even a republican whos just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this white house we need you to join us right now i will not pursue politics by telling people they cant be at our side if theyre not with us 100 of the time this is a time for addition not rejection for belonging not exclusion,10
David Muir, mayor buttigieg thank you i want to turn to climate change and jobs here in america president trump just signed the united statesmexicocanada agreement many call it an updated nafta but it odes include incentives to make cars here in north america and it does open canadian markets for american dairy farmers senator sanders as we sit here in new hampshire tonight both new hampshire senators maggie hassan and senator jeanne shaheen supported this calling it a real win for workers and for farmers you voted no because you said you believe it takes us back years on climate were the senators from new hampshire wrong,10
Bernie Sanders, yes i mean its a disagreement but if you look at every environmental group in this country including the sunrise organization were so proud to have their support because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal i think ever authored by a presidential candidate but they are saying what the environmental groups are saying were simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to mexico there is not one word in that trade agreement ,10
Bernie Sanders, there is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and i dont know how in 2020 you can do that second of all there is in terms of outsourcing of jobs a major crisis in this country nobody believes that under this trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage mexico where workers are paid in some cases less than 2 an hour so i think the right vote was the vote against that agreement i dont apologize for that,10
George S., senator sanders thank you i do want to go to senator klobuchar youve heard what senator sanders just said there he said not one word on climate in the trade deal so why did you vote yes,10
Amy Klobuchar, well first of all i want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from new hampshire jeanne shaheen and maggie hassan who work so hard for this state every day and i voted with them why did i vote with them because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change i think we have to have a north american trading block we have to have mexico and canada and america working together and the best way to take on climate change as president yes ill work to make this a part of every future trade agreement but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement which i will do on day one,10
Amy Klobuchar, it is bringing back the clean power rules it is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that and in future trade agreements that should be part of our negotiations but im telling you right now having no trade agreement with canada and mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with china and pushing china to do better when it comes to climate change,10
George S., senator klobuchar thank you senator warren you voted yes as well,10
Elizabeth Warren, yes i did and ill tell you why because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of donald trumps trade policies there are a lot of workers who are hurting because they cant get enforcement of any workers rights so this nafta provision after a lot of negotiation with democrats senator sherrod brown helped make it a whole lot better this makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when i see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country im saying ill sign up for that and then ill get up tomorrow morning and ill start working hard for a better trade deal on climate a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it everyone wants to get to the american market we should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market,10
George S., mr steyer,10
Tom Steyer, yeah i got to agree with bernie sanders i do senator warren is right everybody wants to get into our market and thats how we convince them that theyve got to be right on climate too that we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way yeah of course we want to make things better for american workers and its absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy were thinking about it from the point of view of the american people not of the american corporations thats a huge positive change and i agree with the senators on that but theres something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy we talked about whether it was right to kill general soleimani and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the united states in the community of nations around the world,10
Tom Steyer, so if we actually want to be the leaders of the world the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks that makes a difference were going to have to put climate first and when we think about doing the wrong thing the way mr trump did with general soleimani we have to ask does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing it absolutely does not,10
Tom Steyer, being all by ourselves being the empire in the star wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world so in fact the usmca is something thats the first step but the second step is exactly what bernie sanders is saying use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent american workers but that we represent the american people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal,10
Amy Klobuchar, one of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things arent always exactly how you would do them but in this case if you want to criticize trump for not ever having any friends and i would agree he always sides with tyrants over innocents he always sides with dictators over allies but i think youve got to have some friends and those two countries our neighbors may not be perfect but they are our friends and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world and we have not talked about this enough,10
Amy Klobuchar, he blames barack obama for everything that goes wrong he blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself he blames the king of denmark who does that he blames the prime minister of canada for he claims cutting him out of the canadian version of home alone 2 who does that thats what donald trump does so my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies and new hampshire is such a great example of this new hampshire bretton woods new hampshire with senators like jeanne shaheen and maggie hassen who believe we need to work with nato and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state but a state that is a piece of the world we cannot be alone and that trade agreement was not perfect but the point of it is if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nations security,10
George S., all right senator klobuchar thanks very much we have hit the two hour mark we need to take a quick break and come back for the final question,10
Devin Dwyer, welcome back to manchester new hampshire and the abc news democratic debate thanks for joining us here on abc news live tonight im devin dwyer joined with our political correspondent rachel scott rachel we heard so much this last block about gun policy abortion climate change and then the issue of race pushed on by tom steyer and really a lot of the candidates confronting joe biden a sign of where this campaign is headed,10
Rachel Scott, exactly devin steyer tonight calling out the lack of discussion when it comes to race on that stage the conversation turning 90 minutes into this debate and biden touting what the national polls reflect his loyalty among african american voters i have sat down with the vice president he has told me its one of the things that he is most proud of his loyalty among black supporters and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base all you have to look at are the numbers from 2016 the exit polls from that primary 6 out of 10 voters in mississippi were black 61 of voters in the south carolina primary were black and thats where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that,10
Devin Dwyer, and to nevada as well with a lot of voters of color there and joe biden holding a lions share of those voters well see if these candidates can chip away you know we were talking so many of the policies we heard about tonight like so many of the previous debates are familiar positions from these candidates which is why the style of their performance tonight is going to get a lot of attention from voters,10
Rachel Scott, it will but you know when i talk to voters as i travel the country they tell me their number one concern is electability they want someone that could be president trump they want someone that could carry this over the finish line and thats why you hear so much of the session pitting back to who can do that on that stage today,10
Devin Dwyer, i was up in derry new hampshire just yesterday hearing not only a lot of attention on those qualities of style but also a lot of anxiety over this issue of electability particularly now with donald trumps polling numbers on the rise his performance at the state of the union and his acquittal in that senate trial its going to be a four day sprint i know youre going to be out there all weekend as i will as well and we were just talking about what this moment in this campaign will mean we could see a dramatically smaller field after tuesday night here in new hampshire,10
Rachel Scott, tom perez came out here and he said listen we are beginning a 90 day sprint most of the delegates are going to be grabbed up by the end of this 90 days and the candidates really have to hone in on their pitch here the voting has started already were moving into the new hampshire primary and a lot of these candidates have a lot on the line here they only have a few days left to gain momentum before that next vote is cast and again this race is getting tighter and tighter,10
Devin Dwyer, and we know donald trump will be here in new hampshire and manchester as well on monday so things are going to get a little even more exciting four days ahead of the new hampshire primaries we had back now for the final question in this abc news democratic debate take a look at the speaking times of the candidates well leave you with that joe biden top of the list all the candidates back at their podiums stay with us right here on abc news live,10
Announcer, the democratic debate here now george stephanopoulos,10
George S., welcome back to our debate time now for a final question each of you will answer it in turn well start with mryang and the question is this according to the childrens defense fund its been more than 20 years since child poverty was directly addressed in a presidential debate the year was 1999 the question was our friend and former  who may be watching right now the late cokie roberts,10
George S., cokie loved the new hampshire primary and she asked the candidates in this republican debate how will we overcome the scandal of one quarter of american preschoolers living in poverty in the richest nation on earth today nearly one in five american preschoolers are still living below the poverty line even though weve had 10 straight years of economic growth what does that say to you about where america is today and what we need to do about it,10
Andrew Yang, george were in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country and unfortunately that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger smarter more capable all the time and most of us are not most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day so if we want to alleviate child poverty we need to put money directly into the hands of families particularly single parents 40 of american children today are born to single moms 90 of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth,10
Andrew Yang, what is the market value my wife evelyn had or stay at home parents around the country zero caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones like kyle christensen in iowa zero volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive zero coaches and mentors helping our kids zero most artists sorry artists but its true zero increasingly local journalists which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you cant vote on something if you actually dont have any news coverage the mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow americans that we each have intrinsic value as citizens as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world,10
Pete Buttigieg, the problem is americas been counting the wrong things now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the dow jones is looking good im sure if youve got a building with your name on it close to wall street then that really is the same thing as the economy to you but the problem is weve had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need or even so many in the middle,10
Pete Buttigieg, when im president were going to measure the performance of our economy not by the dow jones but by the income growth of the 90 because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty just as we focused in south b on cutting the poverty rate in particular the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have this is one more example of something where the american people want to see change the american people not just die hard democrats but so many independents and some republicans think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesnt happen that is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics to turn the page leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late,10
George S., senator warren,10
Elizabeth Warren, so i started my grownup life as a special education teacher i learned early on about the worth of every single human being and i believe that the best investment we can make as a nation the best investment we can make as human beings is to invest in our children weve had enough of making rhetoric around this everyone says they love the kids but heres the deal its time to come up with real plans to make that happen ive talked before about a two cent wealth tax but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care universal prek for every three year old and four year old in america and we can stop exploiting the people largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america,10
Elizabeth Warren, we want to have a real future in this country then invest in our children dont leave public education just to our localities in our states be a good federal partner put real money into our schools put real money into housing put real money into into healthcare put real money into the future of our children thats how we build the america of our best values,10
George S., mr vice president,10
Joe Biden, i come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said weve got to move dont have a job weve got to move to a different city i watched my dad and i met many people here in this state and others who go through the same thing where the fathers made that longest walk or the mothers made that longest walk i was listed for the entire time i was in the united states congress as the poorest man in the united states congress my net worth was net zero a couple of times the fact of the matter is that ive never focused on money for me and i was a single dad for five years its not as hard as being a single mom and i had help from my sisters in the audience and others but the fact is that i think we have to focus on what is at stake here,10
Joe Biden, these arent someone elses children theyre all our children theyre the kite strings that lift our national ambitions they really are they lift our national ambitions aloft we have an overwhelming interest overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well you know 24 out of every 100 students in school today from grade school to high school are latino what are we going to do walk away from that,10
Joe Biden, many of them come from homes that are poor very poor thats why i invest so much time and energy in preschool thats why if i only have 1 to spend i spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating a great number of them as mr yang said arent going on to college although i think we should help with college theyre not going on to college what theyre going to do theyre going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades the new opportunities the new capabilities that are out there we must focus on our children like i said theyre all our children theyre not somebody elses kids everyone everyone everyone everyone as my father would say is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and were not doing it,10
George S., senator sanders,10
Bernie Sanders, well the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth disproportionately high for the african american community by the way is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck the same reason that we have three people in america owning more wealth than the bottom half of america,10
Bernie Sanders, the same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1 and by wealthy campaign contributors our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country what is unique about our campaign is we say unashamedly we are raising our campaign contributions not from billionaires but from working class people that our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run it is time to take on the big money interests it is time to change our national priorities thank you,10
George S., senator klobuchar,10
Amy Klobuchar, in cokies memory let me answer this question we may have lost an election in 2016 democrats but we did not lose hope and there is a way its actually based on a national academy of science report and ive used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation we can do it with investment in childcare we can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done but to get it done we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country,10
Amy Klobuchar, theres an old story of franklin delano roosevelt and when he died his body was put on a train and went up across america and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many americans and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said sir did you know the president and the guy says no i didnt know the president but he knew me he knew me i will tell you this there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the white house right now i will bring that to you,10
Amy Klobuchar, if you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent i know you and i will fight for you if you have trouble deciding if youre going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care i know you and i will fight for you if you have trouble figuring out if youre going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug i know you and i will fight for you i do not have the biggest name up on this stage i dont have the biggest bank account im not a political newcomer with no record but i have a record of fighting for people im asking you to join usamyklobucharcom im asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in america can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me please new hampshire i would love your vote and i would love the vote of america thank you,10
George S., mr steyer,10
Tom Steyer, the republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple its to cut taxes on the richest americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids by cutting healthcare across the board by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement its very simple thats what mr trumps plan is and its true in every single red state but we are not going to win by just criticizing mr trump i know that there is a better america out there and that america lives in our hearts and minds and that america understands that when a kid succeeds in columbia south carolina that is a triumph for every american and the same is true of a kid in las vegas nevada mr trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country its not just that he does bad things he doesnt understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future mobility and justice that is the america that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat mr trump because he will never be able to imagine it so in fact what we need to do is have a new conception a new dream of america dream it and make it happen imagine the mountain and then we climb it together we are in perilous times i am asking for your vote lets rise together,10
George S., candidates thank you thanks for a great debate tonight thanks to our audience here at saint anselm college thanks for our partners wmur and apple news and now id like to send it to my colleague martha raddatz,10
Lester Holt, good evening everyone im lester holt welcome to las vegas everything is on the line tonight with just three days before the critical nevada caucuses here with me on the stage tonight nbc news political director and moderator of meet the press chuck todd and nbc news chief white house correspondent and msnbc anchor hallie jackson also joining us is telemundos senior correspondent vanessa hauc and editor of the nevada independent jon ralston who has covered nevada politics for more than three decades the rules are this tonight candidates will get a minute 15 to answer each question and 45 seconds for followups now that the stage has narrowed to six candidates we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues,11
Lester Holt, so lets get to our first question since the last time you all shared the stage senator sanders a selfdescribed democratic socialist has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race and theres a new person on the stage tonight mayor michael bloomberg a former republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race what hasnt changed a majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating president trump senator sanders the first question to you mayor bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says hes best positioned to win in november why is your revolution a better bet,11
Bernie Sanders, in order to beat donald trump were going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the united states mr bloomberg had policies in new york city of stopandfrisk which went after african american and latino people in an outrageous way that is not a way youre going to grow voter turnout what our movement is about is bringing working class people together black and white and latino native american asian american around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class and that agenda says that maybe just maybe we should join the rest of the industrialized world guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour and have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat donald trump,11
Elizabeth Warren, so id like,11
Lester Holt, mayor bloomberg can senator sanders beat president trump and how do you want to respond to what else he said,11
Michael Bloomberg, i dont think theres any chance of the senator beating president trump you dont start out by saying ive got 160 million people im going to take away the insurance plan that they love thats just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the sanders camp thinks that they can do i dont think theres any chance whatsoever and if he goes and is the candidate we will have donald trump for another four years and we cant stand that,11
Lester Holt, senator warren,11
Elizabeth Warren, id like to talk about who were running against a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians and no im not talking about donald trump im talking about mayor bloomberg democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stopandfrisk look ill support whoever the democratic nominee is but understand this democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another this country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt it is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them that is why i am in this race and that is how i will beat donald trump,11
Lester Holt,  senator klobuchar what do you think the path is from this stage to the white house what works,11
Amy Klobuchar, i think the path is a high voter turnout im the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when i led the tip ticket as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters and ive done that as well and im the only one with the receipts to have done that in republican congressional districts over and over again but i want to say this i actually welcomed mayor bloomberg to the stage i thought that he shouldnt be hiding behind his tv ads and so i was already for this big day and then i looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way that is what his campaign said because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee,11
Amy Klobuchar, i have been told as a woman as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage but i am because of pure grit and because of the people out there ive been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and im not going to do that now and im not going to do that because a campaign memo from mayor bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him i think we need something different than donald trump i dont think you look at donald trump and say we need someone richer in the white house,11
Lester Holt, thank you mayor bloomberg theres a lot for you to respond to there so heres your opportunity,11
Michael Bloomberg, i think we have two questions to face tonight one is who can beat donald trump and number two who can do the job if they get into the white house and i would argue that i am candidate that can do exactly both of those things im a new yorker i know how to take on an arrogant con man like donald trump that comes from new york im a mayor i was a mayor i know how to run a complicated city the biggest most diverse city in this country im a manager i knew what to do after 911 and brought the city back stronger than ever and im a philanthropist who didnt inherit his money but made his money and im spending that money to get rid of donald trump the worst president we have ever had and if i can get that done it will be a great contribution to america and to my kids,11
Lester Holt, vice president biden ill let you weigh in there,11
Joe Biden, in terms who can beat donald trump nbc did a poll yesterday says joe biden is best equipped to beat donald trump thats what your poll said and it said that i can beat him in those toss up states too those states we have to win im ahead by eight points across the board so in terms of being able to beat donald trump im better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat donald trump number one number two the mayor makes an interesting point the mayor says that he has a great record that hes done these wonderful things,11
Joe Biden, well the fact of the matter is he has not managed his city very very well when he was there he didnt get a whole lot done he has stopandfrisk throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall and when we came along in our administration president obama and said were going to send in a mediator to stop it he said thats unnecessary so were going to get a chance to talk about the mayors record but in terms of who is best prepared to beat donald trump look at your poll and what it says,11
Lester Holt, mayor buttigieg youd like to weigh in,11
Pete Buttigieg, yes weve got to wake up as a party we could wake up two weeks from today the day after super tuesday and the only candidates left standing will be bernie sanders and mike bloomberg the two most polarizing figures on this stage and most americans dont see where they fit if theyve got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power lets put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middleclass neighborhood in an industrial midwestern city lets put forward somebody whos actually a democrat look we shouldnt have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out we can do better,11
Lester Holt, senator sanders are you polarizing,11
Bernie Sanders, if speaking to the needs and the pain of a long neglected working class is polarizing i think you got the wrong word what we are trying finally to do is to give a voice to people who have to 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago we are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick of tired of billionaires like mr bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight and thats what we are saying pete is maybe its a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in washington rather than your billionaire campaign contributors,11
Pete Buttigieg, all right look first of all  look my campaign is fueled by hundreds of thousands of contributors,11
Bernie Sanders, including 46 billionaires,11
Pete Buttigieg, among the hundreds of thousands of contributors and look weve got to unite this country to deal with these issues youre not the only one who cares about the working class most americans believe we need to empower workers as a matter of fact youre the one who is at war with the culinary union right here in las vegas we cant,11
Bernie Sanders, we are more union support than you have ever dreamed of,11
Pete Buttigieg, we can,11
Bernie Sanders, we have the support of unions all across this country,11
Pete Buttigieg, yeah but the vision im putting forward has the support of the american people,11
Bernie Sanders, really,11
Pete Buttigieg, we can actually deliver healthcare without taking it away from anyone we can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country and we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking democratic figures and union leaders alike,11
Hallie Jackson, senator warren i have a question for you on sunday on meet the press vice president biden accused senator sanders supporters of bullying union leaders here with vicious malicious misogynistic things you said democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate are senator sanders and his supporters making it harder for democrats to unify in november,11
Elizabeth Warren, look i have said many times before we are all responsible for our supporters and we need to step up thats what leadership is all about but the way we are going to lead this country and beat donald trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock solid values and who actually gets something done when mayor bloomberg was busy blaming african americans and latinos for the housing crash of 2008 i was right here in las vegas literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families,11
Elizabeth Warren, thats when i met mr estrada one of your neighbors he came in to testify and he said he thought hed done everything right with wells fargo but what had happened they took away his house in a matter of weeks this man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools that they might be living out of their van i spent the next years making sure that would never happen again wall street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency they lost and i won we need a candidate with unshakeable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people thats why im in this race,11
Hallie Jackson, senator thank you,11
Elizabeth Warren, and thats how ill beat donald trump,11
Hallie Jackson, senator sanders,11
Bernie Sanders, we have over 106 million people on twitter and 999 of them are decent human beings are working people are people who believe in justice compassion and love and if there are a few people who make ugly remarks who attack trade union leaders i disowned those people they are not part of our movement but let me also say what i hope my friends up here will agree with is that if you look at the wild west of the internet talk to some of the african american women on my campaign talk to senator nina turner talk to others and find the vicious racist sexist attacks that are coming their way as well so i would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet our campaign is about issues its about fighting for the working families and the middle class it is not about vicious attacks on other people,11
Pete Buttigieg, senator when you say that you disown these attacks and you didnt personally direct them i believe you,11
Bernie Sanders, well thank you,11
Pete Buttigieg, but at a certain point you got to ask yourself why did this pattern arise why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens,11
Bernie Sanders, i dont think it is especially the case by the way,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats just not true people,11
Bernie Sanders, pete if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign what you will see is the most ugly sexist racist attacks that are i wont even describe them here theyre so disgusting and let me say something else about this not being too paranoid all of us remember 2016 and what we remember his efforts by russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up im not saying thats happening but it would not shock me i saw some of those tweets regarding the culinary workers union i have a 30 year 100 prounion voting record do you think i would support or anybody supports me would be attacking union leaders its not thinkable,11
Pete Buttigieg, but leadership is about what you draw out of people its about how you inspire people to act and right now were in this toxic political environment leadership isnt just about policy i think at least in broad terms were largely pulling in the same direction on policy but leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people and i think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign and in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others because in order to turn the page,11
Amy Klobuchar, i have an idea i have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet we could nominate a woman for candidate for president of the united states i think that might go a long way if we showed our stuff as a party and the other thing im going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between senator sanders and the culinary union and that is this these are hardworking people housekeepers like elizabeth and i met with last night who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time sweat and blood and that is the truth for so many americans right now,11
Hallie Jackson, senator thank you,11
Amy Klobuchar, there are 149 million americans that would lose their current health insurance under senator sanders bill,11
Hallie Jackson, senator thank you,11
Amy Klobuchar, thats what it says on page eight and i dont think we should forget that,11
Hallie Jackson, on that note i want to turn it over to my colleague chuck todd,11
Chuck Todd, senator sanders im going to stay on this topic on this issue with the culinary union obviously their leaders are warning their members about that your health care plan will take away their healthcare plan take away private insurance completely there are some democrats who like you a lot but worry that this plan medicareforall is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far are they right,11
Bernie Sanders, no let me be very clear two points for a hundred years from teddy roosevelt to barack obama this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for people and yet today despite spending twice as much per capita chuck twice as much as any other major country on earth we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured we got over 60000 people who die every year because they dont get to a doctor on time were getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing 500000 people go bankrupt every year because they cant afford medical bills so let me be very clear to my good friends in the culinary workers union a great union i will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have we will only expand it for them for every union in america and for the working class of this country,11
Chuck Todd, senator warren you were all in on medicareforall and then you have since came up with a transition plan is it because of the impact on unions,11
Elizabeth Warren, so i want to be clear ive been to the culinary unions healthcare facilities theyre terrific you dont want to shut them down you want to expand them you want to see them all across nevada and all across this country but we need to get everybodys healthcare plan out here mayor buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their healthcare its not a plan its a powerpoint and amys plan is even less its like a postit note insert plan here bernie has started very much has a good start,11
Elizabeth Warren, but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work and then his own advisors say eh probably wont happen anyway look healthcare is a crisis in this country my approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can and if we dont get it all the first time take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more,11
Chuck Todd, i promise guys im going to get everybody in,11
Elizabeth Warren, people need our help on this,11
Chuck Todd, i got you mayor buttigieg i think she named checked you first ill let you go first,11
Bernie Sanders, she name checked me second,11
Chuck Todd, yes well okay i think amys second,11
Pete Buttigieg, im more of a microsoft word guy and if you look at my plan i dont know if there are any powerpoints on it but you can definitely find the document on peteforamericacom and youll see that it is a plan that solves the problem makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured american and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have this idea that the union members dont know whats good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies weve been putting forward,11
Pete Buttigieg, here we have a plan that the majority of americans support do you realize how historic that is that the american people are ready in a way far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to president obama at the time theres a powerful american majority ready to undertake the biggest most progressive reform weve had in healthcare in 50 years just so long as we dont force it on anybody what is wrong with that,11
Elizabeth Warren, can i respond to that ,11
Chuck Todd, let me get senator klobuchar and then ill have you respond all right senator klobuchar,11
Bernie Sanders, ,11
Chuck Todd, i think the postit note came first senator ,11
Amy Klobuchar, i must say personal offense since post it notes were invented in my state  okay so my plan is a public option and according to all the studies out there it would reduce premiums for 12 million people immediately it would expand coverage for about that same number it is a significant thing it is what barack obama wanted to do from the very beginning and the way i look at it since were in vegas when it comes to your plan elizabeth and bernies on medicareforall you dont put your money on a number thats not even on the wheel,11
Amy Klobuchar, and why is medicareforall not on the wheel why is it not on the wheel because two thirds of the democratic senators are not even on that bill because a bunch of the new house members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the affordable care act they see it right in front of them and the truth is that when you see some troubled waters you dont blow up a bridge you build one and so we need to improve the affordable care act not blow it up,11
Chuck Todd, all right senator sanders,11
Elizabeth Warren, can i just respond to these two,11
Chuck Todd, i will you name checked three of them let me get senator sanders in there,11
Bernie Sanders, i am also a top,11
Chuck Todd, you were,11
Elizabeth Warren, okay,11
Chuck Todd, go ahead senator sanders well get you in liz we got a lot of people in here that got hit ,11
Bernie Sanders, its my turn yeah,11
Chuck Todd, yes sir,11
Bernie Sanders, okay somehow or another canada can provide universal health care to all their people at half the cost uk can do it france can do germany did all,11
Bernie Sanders,  half the cost uk can do it france can do it germany could all of europe can do it gee whiz somehow or another we are the only major country on earth that cant do it why is that and ill tell you why its because last year the healthcare industry made 100 billion in profits pharmaceutical industry top six companies 69 billion in profit and those ceos are contributing to petes campaign and other campaigns up here,11
Chuck Todd, lets clear this up right now,11
Bernie Sanders, maybe it is finally time that we said as a nation enough is enough the function of a rational healthcare system is not to make the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies rich it is to provide healthcare to all people as a human right not a privilege no premiums,11
Chuck Todd, mr vice president we get it,11
Bernie Sanders, no copayments no deductibles,11
Chuck Todd, go ahead  mr vice president center one,11
Joe Biden, im the only one in this stage that actually got anything done on healthcare im the guy the president turned to and said go get the votes for obamacare and i notice what everybodys talking about is the plan that i first introduced that is to go and add to obamacare provide a public option a medicare like option it cost and increase the subsidies it costs a lot of money it cost 750 billion over 10 years but i pay for it by making sure that mike and other people pay at the same tax rate their secretary pays at thats how we get it paid number one,11
Joe Biden, number two you know from the moment we passed that signature legislation mike called it a disgrace number one number two trump decided to get rid of it and number three my friends here came up with another plan but they dont tell you when you ask bernie how much it costs the last time he said that if he goes on your show he said well find out well find out how or something to that effect it cost over 35 trillion bucks lets get real,11
Chuck Todd, senator warren you get the final word on this were going to move to another question go ahead senator warren,11
Bernie Sanders, and your plan costs 50 trillion,11
Elizabeth Warren, so i actually,11
Michael Bloomberg, what am i chicken liver,11
Elizabeth Warren, so i actually took a look at the plans that are posted mayor buttigieg there are four expenses that families pay right premiums deductibles copays and uncovered medical expenses mayor buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats not true,11
Elizabeth Warren, and that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs amy i looked online at your plan its two paragraphs families are suffering and they need a plan,11
Amy Klobuchar, okay thats it,11
Elizabeth Warren, you cant simply stand here and trash an idea to give healthcare coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own and if youre not going to own up to the fact either that you dont have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without healthcare coverage full coverage then you need to say so i just want to stay on this ,11
Chuck Todd, okay very quickly mayor bloomberg is vice president biden right and you werent a fan of obamacare,11
Michael Bloomberg, i am a fan of obamacare at the beginning ,11
Joe Biden, since when mr mayor,11
Michael Bloomberg, mr vice president i just checked the record because youd said one time that i was not in 09 i testified and gave a speech before the mayors conference in washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on and i think at that time i wrote an article praising obamacare it was either in the new york post or the daily news so the facts are i was ,11
Joe Biden, didnt you call it ,11
Michael Bloomberg, let me finish thank you i was in favor of it i thought it didnt do  go as far as we should what trump has done to this is a disgrace the first thing weve got to do is get the white house and bring back those things that will left and then find a ways to expand it another public option to having some rules about capping charges all of those things we shouldnt just walk away and start something that is totally new untried people ,11
Chuck Todd, okay vice president biden go ahead,11
Joe Biden, the mayor said when we passed it the signature piece of this administration its a disgrace theyre the exact words it was a disgrace look it up check it out it was a disgrace ,11
Chuck Todd, thank you sir lester,11
Lester Holt, all right mayor bloomberg ,11
Female, we havent responded to  allegation,11
Lester Holt,  at the beginning of this debate you took some incoming fire on this next topic so lets get into it in 2015 this is how you described your policing policy as mayor quote we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods and you explain that is quote because thats where all the crime is,11
Lester Holt, you went on to say and the way you should get the guns out of the kids hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them youve apologized for that policy but what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods,11
Michael Bloomberg, well if i go back and look at my time in office the one thing that im really worried about embarrassed about was how it turned out with stop and frisk when i got into office there was 650 murders a year in new york city i thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live thats the basic right of everything and we started we adopted a policy which had been in place the policy that all big police departments use of stop and frisk,11
Michael Bloomberg, what happened however was it got out of control and when we discovered i discovered that we were doing many many too many stop and frisks we cut 95 of it out ive sat down with a bunch of africanamerican clergy and business people to talk about this to try to learn ive talked to a number of kids whod been stopped i was trying to understand how we change our policies so we can keep the city safe because the crime rate did go from 650 50 down to 300 and we have to keep lid on crime but we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately that was what was happening,11
Lester Holt, mayor thank you let me go to vice president biden with this you want to respond to that put an end to it,11
Joe Biden, yes lets get something straight the reason the stop and frisk change is because barack obama sent moderators to see what was going on when we sent them there to say this practice has to stop the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there a terrible idea lets get the facts straight lets get the order straight and its not whether he apologize or not its the policy the policy was abhorrent and it was in fact of violation of every right people have we are the one our administration sent in people to monitor it and the very time the mayor argued against that this idea that he figured out it was a bad idea he figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop even then he continued the policy,11
Lester Holt, all right mayor would you like to make a quick response to that,11
Michael Bloomberg, yes i would ive sat ive apologized ive asked for forgiveness but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people we stopped too many people and weve got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country there is no great answer to a lot of these problems if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers thered be nobody else up here,11
Lester Holt, senator warren,11
Bernie Sanders, lets be clear im sorry who did you call on,11
Lester Holt, senator warren,11
Elizabeth Warren, i do think that this really is about leadership and accountability when the mayor says that he apologized listen very closely to the apology the language he used is about stop and frisk its about how it turned out now this isnt about how it turned out this is about what it was designed to do to begin with it targeted communities of color it targeted black and brown men from the beginning and if you want to issue a real apology then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance day by day by day of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own street shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives you need a different apology,11
Lester Holt, senator thank you chuck,11
Bernie Sanders, can i respond here,11
Chuck Todd, senator klobuchar were going to stay on this topic but i want to get something in here with senator klobuchar when you were the top prosecutor in minneapolis senator there were at least two dozen instances where police were involved in the deaths of civilians none of those officers were prosecuted you did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence now the minneapolis chapter of the naacp has recently called for you to suspend your campaign over that case because some new evidence has come out since big picture why should black and latino voters trust your judgment now if it appears you may have gotten it wrong then,11
Amy Klobuchar, first ill start with that case it is very clear that any evidence if there is new evidence even old evidence it should be reviewed by that office and by the county attorney that must happen i have called for that review this was a case involving an 11yearold africanamerican girl named tyesha edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table three people were convicted one of the cases is the one that is being investigated  was investigated by a journalist and i think its very important that that evidence come forward,11
Amy Klobuchar, in terms of the police shootings that you noted those went to a grand jury every single one of them and i made very clear for months now that like so many prosecutors i think those cases in my time they were all going to the grand jury it was thought that was the best way to handle them in many many jurisdictions,11
Moderator, do you think you shouldve spoke up you didnt speak up at the time should you,11
Amy Klobuchar, i actually did speak up on something very similar and that was when our police chief in minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands i strongly said i disagreed with that now i do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself,11
Amy Klobuchar, and the last thing i will say because you asked the question about voting i have the support of africanamericans in my community in every election i had strong support and strong support of leadership and thats because i earned it and this is going to be on me to earn it you earn it with what you stand for when it comes to equal opportunity you earn it with the work that i have done the leadership ive shown on voting rights and yes you earn it with the work that must be done on criminal justice reform,11
Moderator, thank you senator hallie jackson,11
Hallie Jackson, i wan to talk about transparency here  many democrats including most of you on stage have criticized president trump for his lack of transparency but senator sanders when you are here in las vegas in october you are hospitalized with a heart attack afterwards you pledged to make a quote all your medical records public youve released three letters from your doctors but you now say you wont release anything more what happened to your promise of full transparency,11
Bernie Sanders, i think we did let me tell you what happened first of all youre right and thank you las vegas for the excellent medical care i got in the hospital two days and i think the one area maybe that mayor bloomberg and i share you have stents as well,11
Michael Bloomberg, 25 years ago,11
Bernie Sanders, well we both have two stents its a procedure that is done about a million times a year so we released the full report of that heart attack second of all we released the full my whole 29 years in the capitol the attending physician all of my history medical history and furthermore we released reports from two leading vermont cardiologist who described my situation and by the way who said bernie sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the united states hey follow me around the campaign trail three four five events a day see how youre doing compared to me,11
Hallie Jackson, mayor buttigieg youve been critical about transparency on this stage and people needing to do better is that response from senator sanders enough for you,11
Pete Buttigieg, no its not because first of all let me say we are all delighted that you are in fighting shape,11
Bernie Sanders, thank you,11
Pete Buttigieg, and at the same time transparency matters especially living through the trump era now under president obama the standard was that the president would release full medical records do a physical and release the readout i think thats the standard that we should hold ourselves to as well now president trump lowered that standard he said just a letter from a doctor is enough and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying thats enough but i am certainly prepared to get a physical put out the results i think everybody here should be willing to do the same but im actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on sanders personal health than i am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan,11
Pete Buttigieg, since he said that its impossible to even know how much its going to cost and even after raising taxes on everybody making 29000 there is still a multitrillion dollar hole matter of fact if you add up his policies altogether they come to 50 trillion hes only explained 25 trillion worth of revenue which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the united states,11
Hallie Jackson, mayor buttigieg,11
Pete Buttigieg, the time has come to level with the american people on matters personal and on matters of policy,11
Hallie Jackson, thank you senator sanders quickly,11
Bernie Sanders, lets level lets level pete under your plan which is a maintenance continuation of the status quo,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats,11
Bernie Sanders, can i finish the average american today is paying 12000 a year thats what that family is paying 20 of a 60000 income 12000 a year highest prices in the world for prescription drugs just the other day a major study came out from yale epidemiologists in lancet one of the leading medical publications in the world what they said my friends is medicare for all will save 450 billion a year because we are eliminated the absurdity of thousands of separate plans that required hundreds of billions of dollars of administration and by the way ending the hundred billion a year in profiteering for the drug companies and the insurance companies,11
Pete Buttigieg, this is really important ,11
Hallie Jackson, senator sanders thank you mayor bloomberg i want to go to you on this,11
Bernie Sanders, your plan by the way  costs,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats false look if my plan is to status quo why was it attacked by the insurance industry the moment it came out and on issue after issue after issue this is what senator sanders is saying if youre not with him if youre not all the way on his side then you must be for the status quo well you know what that is a picture that leaves most of the american people out,11
Hallie Jackson, i want to go to mayor bloomberg on this the transparency issue,11
Hallie Jackson, very briefly on transparency mayor bloomberg your campaign has said that you would eventually release your tax records,11
Michael Bloomberg, yes,11
Hallie Jackson,  when it comes to transparency but people are already voting now why should democratic voters have to wait,11
Michael Bloomberg, it just takes us a long time unfortunately or fortunately,11
Amy Klobuchar, can i comment on that,11
Michael Bloomberg, fortunately i make a lot of money and we do business all around the world and we are preparing it the number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages i cant go to turbo tax but i put out my tax return every year for 12 years in city hall we will put out this one it says tells everybody everything they need to know about every investments that i make and where the money goes and the biggest item is all the money i give away and we list that every single donation i make and you can get that from our foundation anytime you want,11
Amy Klobuchar, im just looking at my husband in the front row that has to like do our taxes all the time we probably could go to turbo tax and the point of this is i believe in transparency i had a physical by the way it came out well we might all be surprised if my blood pressure is lower than mayor petes that might really shock everyone out there and i think you should release your records from your physical,11
Amy Klobuchar, secondly when it comes to tax returns everyone up here has released their tax returns mayor and it is a major issue because the president of the united states has been hiding behind his tax returns even when courts order him to come forward with those tax returns i dont care how much money anyone has i think its great you got a lot of money but i think youve got to come forward with your tax returns,11
Hallie Jackson, senator warren im going to get to you in a second mayor bloomberg quick response to senator klobuchar,11
Michael Bloomberg, were releasing them theyll be out in a few weeks and thats just as fast as i can do it remember i only entered into this race 10 weeks ago all of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats right we have,11
Michael Bloomberg, and we did not ,11
Pete Buttigieg, engaging with voters and humbling ourselves in backyards ,11
Hallie Jackson, let me ask you about something else mr mayor because,11
Elizabeth Warren, 10 weeks ago  over time and get it done,11
Hallie Jackson, mayor bloomberg let me ask you about something else senator warren,11
Michael Bloomberg, wish it were that simple,11
Hallie Jackson, ill let you get in here but mayor bloomberg,11
Michael Bloomberg, it would save me a lot of money,11
Hallie Jackson, let me ask you about something else several former employees have claimed that your company was a hostile workplace for women when you were confronted about it you admitted making sexually suggestive remarks saying quote thats the way i grew up in a lawsuit in the 1990s according to the washington post one former female employee alleged that you said quote i would do you in a second should democrats expect better from their nominee,11
Michael Bloomberg, let me say a couple things and if i can have my full minute and a quarter thank you i have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the me too movement has exposed and anybody that does anything wrong in our company we investigate it and if its appropriate theyre gone that day but let me tell you what i do in my company and my foundation and in city government when i was there in my foundation the person that runs its a woman 70 of the people there are women in my company lots and lots of women have big responsibilities they get paid exactly the same as men and in city hall the person thats the top person my deputy mayor was a woman and 40 of our commissioners were women,11
Michael Bloomberg, i am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago we were awarded we were voted the most  the best place to work second best place in america if that doesnt say something about our employees and how happy they are i dont know what does,11
Hallie Jackson, senator warren youve been critical of mayor bloomberg on this issue,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes i have i hope youve heard what his defense was ive been nice to some women that just doesnt cut it the mayor has to stand on his record and what we need to know is exactly whats lurking out there he has gotten some number of women  dozens who knows  to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace so mr mayor are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story,11
Michael Bloomberg, we have a very few nondisclosure agreements,11
Elizabeth Warren, how many is that,11
Michael Bloomberg, let me finish,11
Elizabeth Warren, how many is that,11
Michael Bloomberg, none of them accused me of doing anything other than maybe they didnt like a joke i told these would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and thats up to them they signed those agreements and well live with it,11
Joe Biden, come on,11
Elizabeth Warren, so wait when you say a  i just want to be clear some is how many and when you say they signed them and they wanted them if they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they alleged thats now okay with you youre releasing them on television tonight,11
Michael Bloomberg, senator no,11
Elizabeth Warren, is that right,11
Michael Bloomberg, senator the company and somebody else in this  the man or a woman or could be more than that they decided when they made an agreement that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybodys interests,11
Elizabeth Warren, no,11
Joe Biden, come on,11
Michael Bloomberg, they sign the agreements and thats what were going to live,11
Pete Buttigieg, they could release them now,11
Elizabeth Warren, im sorry no the question is are the women,11
Michael Bloomberg, i heard your question,11
Elizabeth Warren,  bound by being muzzled by you and you could release them from that immediately because understand this is not just a question of the mayors character this is also a question about electability we are not going to be donald trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip drip drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against thats not what we do as democrats,11
Elizabeth Warren,  and discriminated against thats not what we do as democrats,11
Hallie Jackson, mr vice president,11
Joe Biden, look lets get something straight here its easy all the mayor has to do is say you are released from the nondisclosed agreement period we talk about transparency here this guy got himself in trouble and he couldnt disclose what he did he went to his company,11
Pete Buttigieg, to be super clear that was about the list of clients so nobody gets the wrong idea,11
Joe Biden, no no im sorry,11
Pete Buttigieg, i know what you mean no youre right,11
Joe Biden, he went to the company and said i want to be released i want to be able to do it look this is about transparency from the very beginning whether its your health record whether its your taxes whether you have cases against you whether or not people have signed nondisclosure agreements you think that women in fact were ready to say i dont want anybody to know about what you did to me thats not how it works the way it works is they say look this is what you did to me and the mayor comes along and his attorney said i will give you this amount of money if you promise youll never say anything thats how it works,11
Hallie Jackson, mayor bloomberg final word to you,11
Michael Bloomberg, ive said were not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect that they will stay private,11
Joe Biden, if they want to release it they should be able to release themselves say yes,11
Bernie Sanders, you know we talk about electability and everybody up here wants to beat trump and we talked about stop and frisk and  has established and the problems there but maybe we should also ask how mayor bloomberg in 2004 supported george w bush for president put money into republican candidates for the united states senate when some of us joe and i and others were fighting for democrats to control the united states senate,11
Joe Biden, ,11
Bernie Sanders, maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut social security medicare and medicaid if thats a way to beat donald trump wow i would be very surprised,11
Hallie Jackson, thank you senator vanessa to you,11
Michael Bloomberg, wait wait,11
Vanessa Hauc, senator klobuchar youre running om your washington experience but last week in a telemundo interview you could not name the president of mexico or discuss any of his policies last night you defended yourself saying this isnt jeopardy but my question to you is shouldnt our next president know more about one of our largest trading partners,11
Amy Klobuchar, of course of course and i dont think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what i know about mexico and how much i care about it and i first want to say greetings to president lopez obrador secondly what i meant the game of jeopardy is that i think we could all come up with things you know how many members are there in the israeli knesset 120 who is the president of honduras,11
Vanessa Hauc, senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, hernandez,11
Vanessa Hauc, senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, when it comes to mexico i am the one person on this stage that came out first to say i was for the us mexican canadian trade agreement that is going to be one of the number one duties of a president is to implement that,11
Vanessa Hauc, senator klobuchar my colleague specifically asked you if you could name the president of mexico and your response was no,11
Amy Klobuchar, yes thats right and i said that i made an error i think having a president that maybe is humble and is able to admit that here and there maybe wouldnt be a bad thing,11
Vanessa Hauc, mayor buttigieg your response ,11
Pete Buttigieg, yeah look i wouldnt liken this to trivia im actually didnt know how many members were in the knesset so you got me there,11
Amy Klobuchar, well there you go,11
Pete Buttigieg, but youre staking your candidacy on your washington experience youre on the committee that oversees border security youre on the committee that does trade youre literally part of the committee thats overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south,11
Amy Klobuchar, are you trying to say that im dumb are you mocking me here pete,11
Pete Buttigieg, im saying you shouldnt trivialize that knowledge,11
Amy Klobuchar, i said i made an error people sometimes forget names i am the one that has number one has the experience based on passing over 100 bills,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you senator,11
Amy Klobuchar, if i could respond this was a pretty big allegation,11
Vanessa Hauc, quickly please,11
Amy Klobuchar, hes basically saying that i dont have the experience to be president of the united states i have passed over 100 bills as the lead democrat since being in the us senate i am the one not you that has won statewide in congressional district after congressional district and i will say when you tried in indiana pete to run what happened to you you lost by over 20 points to someone who later lost to my friend joe donnelly so dont tell me about experience what unites us here is we want to win and i think we should put a proven winner in charge of the ticket,11
Vanessa Hauc, your response mayor buttigieg,11
Pete Buttigieg, this is the race for president if winning a race for senate in minnesota translated directly to becoming president i would have grown up under the presidency of walter mondale this is different and the reason that i think we need to talk about washington experience is that we should ask what that experience has led to experiences and certainly tenure is not always the same thing as judgment if were going to talk about votes in the senate in washington lets talk ,11
Lester Holt, hello hello hello thank you  senator warren and mayor bloomberg this question is for you i want to talk about and maybe this is appropriate here,11
Elizabeth Warren, can i just defend senator klobuchar for a minute this is not right i understand that she forgot a name it happens it happens to everybody on this stage look you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with mexico have at it and if you get it wrong man you ought to be held accountable for that you want to ask about the economy and you get it wrong you ought to be held accountable you want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong you ought to be held accountable but lets just be clear missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand whats going on and i just think this is unfair ,11
Vanessa Hauc, senator warren youre right but senator klobuchar could not discuss mexican policy either,11
Elizabeth Warren, fair enough,11
Joe Biden, im the only one who knows this man and met with him,11
Amy Klobuchar, i do have to respond,11
Joe Biden, come on man,11
Amy Klobuchar, ,11
Joe Biden, ive spent more time in mexico than anybody can i get a chance to say something,11
Pete Buttigieg, hold on,11
Bernie Sanders, si,11
Joe Biden, si thank you look im the only who spent extensive hundreds of hours in latin america ive met with this president ive met with the last president the one before,11
Jon Ralston, so you all ready to play some nevada trivia now im only half joking here lets talk about this issue because its up there and polls voters are really concerned about it as you all know what you might not know is that las vegas and reno are the vibrant economic engines for the state of nevada and are also two of the fastest warming cities in the country in certain months of the year the heat is already an emergency situation for residents and for tourists walking up and down the strip so im going to start with you mr vice president what specific policies would you implement that would keep las vegas and reno livable but also not hurt those economies,11
Joe Biden, it is the existential threat that humanity faces global warming i went out to check and you have a facility where you have the one of the largest largest solar panel arrays in the world and when the fourth stage is completed youll be able to take care of 60000 homes for every single bit of their needs and what i would do is number one work on providing the 47 billion we have for tech and to making sure we find answers is to provide a way to transmit that wind and solar energy across the network of all the united states invest in battery technology,11
Joe Biden, i would immediately restate all of the elimination of what trump has eliminated in terms of epa i would secondly make sure that we had 500000 new charging stations in every new highway we built in the united states of america or repaired i would make sure that we once again made sure that we got the mileage standards back up which would have saved over 12 billion barrels of oil had he not walked away from it and i would invest in rail in rail rail can take hundreds of thousands millions of cars off the road if we have high speed rail,11
Jon Ralston, thank you mr vice president i want to get some of the rest of you in on this because yall have plans mayor bloomberg let me read what you said about this issue you said you want to intensify us and international actions to stop the expansion of coal how exactly are you going to do that,11
Michael Bloomberg, well already weve closed 304 out of the 530 coalfired power plants in the united states and weve closed 80 out of the 200 or 300 that are in europe bloomberg philanthropies working with the sierra club thats one of the things you do but just lets start at the beginning if youre president the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the paris agreement this is just ridiculous for us to drop out two americas responsibility is to be the leader in the world and if we dont were the ones that are going to get hurt just as much as anybody else and thats why i dont want to have us cut off our relationships with china because you will never solve this problem without china and india western europe and america thats for most of the  let me just finish one other thing i believe and you can tell me whether this is right but the solar array that the vice president was talking about is being closed because its not economic that you can put solar panels in and modern technology even more modern than that,11
Jon Ralston, mayor i want to let senator warren jump in here just because youve said something thats really specific to nevada the tension here in this state is between people want renewable energy and people want conservation on public lands 85 of nevada is managed by the federal government you have said that you are going to have an executive order that would stop drilling on public lands stop mining which is a huge industry here you got to have lithium you got to have copper for renewable energy how do you do that,11
Elizabeth Warren, so look i think we should stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling if we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that weve got to have access to then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries but in a way that is sustainable for the environment we cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who dont care about our environment and are not making it better look im going to say something that is really controversial in washington but i think im safe to say this here in nevada i believe in science and i believe that the way were going to deal with this problem is that we are going to increase by 10 fold our investment in science,11
Elizabeth Warren, theres an upcoming 27 trillion market worldwide for green and much of what is needed has not yet been invented my proposal is lets invent it here in the united states and then say we invent in the us youve got to build it in the us thats a million new manufacturing,11
Chuck Todd, were going to stick to this topic but senator sanders im going to move to fracking you want a total ban on natural gas extraction fracking in the next five years the industry obviously supports a lot of jobs around the country including thousands in the battleground state of pennsylvania one union official there told the new york times if we end up with a democratic candidate that supports a fracking ban im going to tell my members that either you dont vote or you vote for the other guy what do you tell these workers its supporting a big industry right now sir,11
Bernie Sanders, what i tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us that if we dont act incredibly boldly within the next six seven years there will be irreparable damage done not just in nevada not just to vermont or massachusetts but to the entire world joe said it right this is an existential threat you know what that means chuck that means were fighting for the future of this planet and the green new deal that i support by the way will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy this is a moral issue my friends we have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable that is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry,11
Chuck Todd, i want to keep this going senator klobuchar youre not on the same page at a total ban of fracking you call it a transitional fuel but scientists are sounding this alarm now do you take these warnings that maybe fracking as a step backwards not a step forward not a transition,11
Amy Klobuchar, i made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that its safe but it is a transitional fuel and i want to add something that really hasnt been brought up by my colleagues this is a crisis and a lot of our plans are very similar to get to carbon neutral by 2045 2050 something like that but were not going to be able to pass this unless we bring people with us im looking at these incredible senators from nevada catherine cortez masto and jacky rosen and im thinking that they know how important this is and you can do this in a smart way one get back into that international climate change agreement two clean power rules bring those back a president can do this herself without congress as well as the gas mileage standards but when it comes to putting a sweep a price on carbon  this is very important chuck,11
Amy Klobuchar, we have to make sure that that money goes back directly as dividends to the people that are going to need help for paying their bills otherwise were not going to pass it so there has to be a heart to the policy to get this done,11
Chuck Todd, senator warren address the worker issue if you dont mind as well can you address the worker issue,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes we can have a green new deal and create jobs we need people in infrastructure who will help build we have manufacturing,11
Chuck Todd, they could lose that job tomorrow though thats what theyre concerned about,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes those jobs are for tomorrow those are the ones we need to be working on to harden our infrastructure right now but listen to senator klobuchars point she says we have to think smaller in order to get it passed i dont think thats the right approach here why cant we get anything passed in washington on climate everyone understands the urgency but weve got two problems the first is corruption an industry that makes its money felt all through washington the first thing i want to do in washington is pass my anticorruption bill so that we can start making the changes we need to make on climate and the second is the filibuster if youre not willing to roll back the filibuster then youre giving the fossil fuel industry a veto over all of the work that we need to do,11
Chuck Todd, senator thank you vanessas got the next question,11
Amy Klobuchar, can i respond she ,11
Vanessa Hauc, vice president biden you have said that you want to hold the oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet you have even suggested that you might put them in jail which companies are you talking about and how far are you willing to go,11
Joe Biden, im willing to go as far as we have to first of all i would eliminate all the subsidies we have for oil and gas eliminate it period that would save millions and millions billions of dollars number two i think that any executive who was engaged in  and by the way minority communities are the communities that would be most badly hurt by the way in which we deal with climate change they are the ones that become the victims thats where the asthma is thats where the groundwater supply has been polluted thats where in fact people in fact do not have the opportunity to be able to get away from everything from still asbestos in the walls of our schools,11
Joe Biden, i have a trillion dollar program for infrastructure that will provide for thousands and thousands of new jobs not 15 an hour but 50 an hour plus benefits unions unions being able to do that and what it does is it will change the nature  look heres the last point my times going to run out heres the last point i want to make to you on day one when im elected president im going to invite all of the members of the paris accord to washington dc they make up 85 of the problem they know me im used to dealing with international relations i will get them to up the ante in a big way,11
Vanessa Hauc, vice president biden you didnt answer to my questions,11
Joe Biden, i thought i did,11
Vanessa Hauc, what would you do with these companies that are responsible for the destruction of our planet,11
Joe Biden, what would i do with them i would make sure they number one stop number two if you demonstrate that they in fact have done things already that are bad and theyve been lying they should be able to be sued they should be able to be held personally accountable and they should  not only not only the company not the stock holders but the ceos of those companies they should be engaged and its a little bit like look this is the industry we should be able to sue we should go after just like we did the drug companies just like we did with the tobacco companies the only company we cant go after our gun manufacturers because of my buddy here but thats a different,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you vice president,11
Lester Holt, were going to stay on the topic my question is to mayor bloomberg mayor bloomberg your business is heavily invested in china i think you mentioned that a few questions back the number one producer in the world of carbon emissions how far would you go to force china to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis,11
Michael Bloomberg, well youre not going to go to war with them you have to negotiate with them and try to  and weve seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us what you have to do is convince the chinese that is in their interest as well their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we work together in all fairness the chinese have slowed down its india that is even bigger problem but it is an enormous problem nobodys doing anything about it we could right here in america make a big difference were closing the coalfired power plants if we enforced some of the rules on fracking so that they dont release methane into the air and into the water youll make a big difference but were not going to get rid of fracking for while and we frack incidentally not just natural gas you frack oil as well it is a technique and when its done poorly like theyre doing it in too many places where the methane gets out into the air it is very damaging,11
Michael Bloomberg, but its a transition fuel i think the senator said it right we want to go to all renewables but thats still many years from now and before i think the senator mentioned 2050 for some data no scientist thinks the numbers for 2050 or 2050 anymore theyre 2040 2035 the world is coming apart faster than any scientific study had predicted we just got to do something now ,11
Lester Holt, mayor buttigieg your thoughts,11
Pete Buttigieg, lets be real about the deadline its not 2050 its not 2040 its not 2030 its 2020 because if we dont elect a president who actually believes in climate science now we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to so first of all lets make sure were actually positioned to win which once again if we put forward two of the most polarizing figures on this stage as the only option its going to be a real struggle,11
Pete Buttigieg, now ive got a plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050 and i think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same so the real question is how are we going to actually get it done we need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done,11
Pete Buttigieg, how do you do it well first of all making sure that those jobs are available quickly secondly ensuring that we are pulling in those very sectors who have been made to feel like theyre part of the problem from farming to industry and fund as well as urge them to do the right thing and then global climate diplomacy im a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with china america has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape chinese ambitions but what we can do is ensure that we use the hard tools ,11
Chuck Todd, hold here for a second senator warren,11
Pete Buttigieg, policy to enforce what has to happen,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes i want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate because for generations now in this country toxic waste dumps polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color over and over and over and the consequences are felt in the health of young african american babies its felt in the health of seniors people with compromised immune systems,11
Elizabeth Warren, its also felt economically who wants to move into an area where the air smells bad or you cant drink the water i have a commitment of 1 trillion to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on communities of color for generations now we have to own up to our responsibility we cannot simply talk about climate change in big global terms we need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged,11
Chuck Todd, senator warren thank you ,11
Helen, i want to ask you about something else that is important to people here i want to ask you about latinos owning one out of every four new businesses in the united states many of them have benefited from president trumps tax cuts and they may be hesitant about new taxes or regulations will taxes on their small businesses go up under your administration,11
Joe Biden, no taxes and small  matter of fact were going to make sure theres more money available for small businesses in the latino community in the black community to be able to get the capital to start businesses at the treasury department theres going to be a window available where we significantly increase the amount of money available so people can borrow the money to get started they have demonstrated theyre incredibly successful,11
Joe Biden, we should not be raising taxes on them we should start rewarding work not just wealth thats why we have to change the tax code the way it is thats why the wealthy have to start to pay their fair share and thats why we have to focus on giving people the ability to garner wealth generate wealth and thats why this whole idea of red lining lending to people in areas wasnt the cause of wall street failing the greed of wall street was the reason why it occurred not the red lining,11
Joe Biden, and lastly i want to say look the idea of china china is and their belt and road proposal theyre taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of mongolia and spreading it around the world its clear make it clear when you call them to washington in the first 100 days if you continue you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose tariffs on everything youre selling because you are undercutting the entire economy,11
Helen, thank you mr vice president mayor buttigieg will taxes on those businesses go up under you,11
Pete Buttigieg, not if they are small businesses i mean what weve got to do is level the playing field where a company like amazon or chevron is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits and it puts small businesses like the ones that are revitalizing my own city often latino owned on our west side at a disadvantage we need to recognize that investing in latino entrepreneurship is not just an investment in the latino community it is an investment in the future of america and it is time for a president who understands the value of immigration in lifting up all of our communities and our country we are getting the exact opposite message from the current president and it is time to recognize not just the diversity of the latino community but the importance of issues like economic empowerment healthcare as well as ,11
Elizabeth Warren, we have an entrepreneurship gap in america and that is a gap between white entrepreneurs and black and latino entrepreneurs and the principle reason for this is they dont have the money for equity to get the businesses started its about a 7 billion gap we want to have real entrepreneurship and a level playing field i have a plan to put the 7 billion in to have the fund managed by the people who are routinely cut out it cant just be about taxes,11
Helen, thank you senator,11
Elizabeth Warren, we need to make an investment to level the playing field and in the black ,11
Chuck Todd, excuse me i want to get at something mayor bloomberg the vice president talked about red lining,11
Michael Bloomberg, im the only one here thats started a business,11
Chuck Todd, mayor bloomberg you seem to imply that red lining and stopping red lining has somehow contributed to the financial crisis,11
Michael Bloomberg, no thats exactly wrong,11
Chuck Todd, and that was the implication that came out in the quote so i want to give you a chance to clarify this,11
Michael Bloomberg, well on the record against red lining since i worked on wall street i was against it during the financial crisis ive been against it since the financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages packaged them and other people bought them that was where all the disaster was red lining is still a practice some places and weve got to cut it out but its just not true,11
Michael Bloomberg, what i was going to say maybe you want to talk about businesses im the only one here i think thats ever started a business is that fair okay what do we need is i can tell you in new york city we had programs there are mentoring programs for the young business people so they can learn how to start a business we had programs that could get them seed capital we have programs to get branch banking in their neighborhoods because if you dont have a branch bank there you cant get a checking account cant get a checking account you cant get a loan you cant get a loan you cant get a mortgage then you dont have any wealth theres ways to fix this and it doesnt take trillions of dollars it takes us to focus on the problems of small business,11
Chuck Todd, senator sanders 45 seconds then were going to move on senator sanders 45 seconds,11
Bernie Sanders, all right when we talk about a corrupt political system bought by billionaires like mr bloomberg it manifests itself in a tax code in which not only is amazon and many other major corporations some owned by the wealthiest people in this country not paying a nickel in taxes we have the insane situation that billionaires today if you can believe it have an effective tax rate lower than the middleclass so maybe just,11
Michael Bloomberg, senator youre writing the tax code why are you complaining who wrote the code,11
Bernie Sanders, you did you and your campaign contributions,11
Michael Bloomberg, you and the other 99 senators,11
Bernie Sanders, not me you and your campaign contributions are electing people to represent the wealthy and the powerful,11
Michael Bloomberg, yes those are the democrats thank you,11
Bernie Sanders, well and republicans too and george w bush as well,11
Chuck Todd, senator klobuchar let me address,11
Amy Klobuchar, i was just i was thinking there was going to be a rematch on saturday in vegas and those guys should go down there,11
Chuck Todd, senator klobuchar i actually want to get you to something about senator sanders tweeted last year billionaires should not exist what say you,11
Amy Klobuchar, okay i believe in capitalism but i think the goal of someone in government and a president of the united states should be a check on that im not going to limit what people make but i think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is whats wrong i was thinking of your question about small businesses the small businesses i talked to they have trouble getting employees because their employees dont have childcare we should have universal childcare and we have not been talking enough about donald trump and lets just talk about donald trump because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy and he went down maralago and he said to all his friends you just got a lot richer that is exhibit a and i can tell you the hardworking people in nevada were not in that room so the key to me is to not limit what people can make but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone,11
Chuck Todd, so senator sanders what did you mean that you dont think they should exist what did that mean,11
Bernie Sanders, ill tell you what i mean we have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth income mike bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million americans thats wrong thats immoral that should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt we have enormous problems facing this country and we cannot continue seeing a situation where in the last three years billionaires in this country saw an 850 billion increase in their wealth congratulations mr bloomberg but the average american last year saw less than a 1 increase in his or her income thats wrong,11
Chuck Todd, mayor bloomberg should you exist,11
Michael Bloomberg, i cant speak for all billionaires all i know is ive been very lucky made a lot of money and im giving it all away to make this country better and a good chunk of it goes to the democratic party as well,11
Chuck Todd, is it too much have you earned too much money has it been an obscene amount of  should you have earned that much money,11
Michael Bloomberg, yes i worked very hard for it and im giving it away,11
Chuck Todd, thank you helen,11
Helen, mayor senator sanders has a proposal that will require all large companies to turn over up to 20 of their ownership to employees over time is that a good idea,11
Pete Buttigieg, i think that employee ownership of companies is a great idea im not sure it makes sense to command those companies to do it if we really want to deliver less inequality in this country then weve got to start with the tax code and weve got to start with investments in how people are able to live the american dream which is in serious serious decline matter of fact last time i checked the list of countries to live out the american dream in other words to be born at the bottom and come out at the top were not even in the top 10 number number one place to live out the american dream right now is denmark,11
Pete Buttigieg, and as the i think the lone person on this stage whos not a millionaire let alone a billionaire i believe that part of what needs to change is for the voices of the communities that havent felt heard on wall street or in washington to actually be brought to capitol hill its why i am building a politics designed around inclusion designed around belonging because the one thing that will definitely perpetuate the income inequality were living with right now is for donald trump to be reelected because we polarize this country with the wrong nominees,11
Helen, senator sanders its your policy,11
Bernie Sanders, thats me right,11
Helen, it is your policy,11
Bernie Sanders, thank you it is my policy and im very proud of that policy what we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is make sure that those people who are working you know what mr bloomberg it wasnt you who made all that money maybe your workers played some role in that as well and it is important that those workers are able to share the benefits also when we have so many people go to work every day and they feel not good about their jobs they feel like cogs in a machine i want workers to be able to sit on corporate boards as well so they can have some say of what happens to their lives,11
Helen, mayor bloomberg you own a large company would you support what senator sanders is proposing,11
Michael Bloomberg, absolutely not i cant think of a way that would make it easier for donald trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation this is ridiculous were not going to throw out capitalism we tried that other countries tried that it was called communism and it just didnt work,11
Elizabeth Warren, so let me make a proposal that will work that has not only support from a majority of democrats but also from a majority of the independents and a majority of republicans and that is a two cent wealth tax on all fortunes above 50 million you hit a billion youve got to pay a few pennies more this is a tax on the top 110th of 1 in america and it permits us to start to restructure our economy it means we can afford universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five it means we can have universal prek for every child in america it means we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher and stop exploiting the black and brown women who do this work it means we can put 800 billion into our public schools quadruple funding for title one schools,11
Elizabeth Warren, and as a former special education teacher we could fully fund idea so children with disabilities would get the full education they need we can do college we can put 50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities and we could cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans thats something a majority of americans support a two cent wealth tax it is a question of values do we want to invest in mr bloomberg or do we want to invest in an entire generation,11
Chuck Todd, senator sanders my next question is for you senator sanders our latest nbc news wall street journal poll released yesterday two thirds of all voters said they were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for president what do you say to those voters sir,11
Bernie Sanders, what was the result of that poll who was winning,11
Chuck Todd, the questions to you,11
Bernie Sanders, well the question was that i was winning and i think by a fairly comfortable margin you might mention that but here is the point lets talk about democratic socialism not communism mr bloomberg thats a cheap shot lets talk about democratic lets talk about what goes on in countries like denmark where pete correctly pointed out they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do what are we talking about,11
Bernie Sanders, we are living in many ways in a socialist society right now problem is as dr martin luther king reminded us we have socialism for the very rich rugged individualism for the poor,11
Michael Bloomberg, wait a second,11
Bernie Sanders, let me finish when donald trump gets 800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums thats socialism for the rich walmart we have to subsidize walmarts workers who are on medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in america pays starvation wages thats socialism for the rich i believe in democratic socialism for working people not billionaires health care for all and educational opportunities for all,11
Chuck Todd, senator thank you mayor bloomberg would you like to ,11
Bernie Sanders, creating a government to works  for all not just mr bloomberg,11
Chuck Todd, the question was about socialism,11
Michael Bloomberg, what a wonderful country we have the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses whatd i miss here,11
Bernie Sanders, well you missed that i work in washington house one,11
Michael Bloomberg, thats the first problem,11
Bernie Sanders, live in burlington house two,11
Michael Bloomberg, thats good,11
Bernie Sanders, and like thousands of other vermonters i do have a summer camp forgive me for that where is your home which tax,11
Bernie Sanders,  cap forgive me for that where is your home which tax haven do you have your home,11
Michael Bloomberg, new york new york city thank you very much and i pay all my taxes and im happy to do it because i get something for it and let me say i thought that the senator next to me was halfright,11
Elizabeth Warren, ,11
Michael Bloomberg, i agree we should raise taxes on the  i disagree with the senator on the wealth tax but i do agree with her that the rich arent paying their fair share we should raise taxes on the rich i did that as mayor in new york city i raised taxes and if you take a look at my plans the first thing i would do is try to convince congress because theyve got to do it we cant just order it to roll back the tax cuts that the trump administration put in through congress,11
Elizabeth Warren, joe can we talk,11
Lester Holt, vice president biden weigh in on this question of americans feeling about socialist candidates,11
Joe Biden, well look let me weigh in on you know for 36 years and as vice president i was listed as the poorest man in congress i made money when i wrote a book about my son and it surprised me how much it sold first time i ever made any money and heres the deal the fact is that we ought to start rewarding work not just wealth the idea that we have a tax rate for corporate america at 21 is ridiculous it should be at 28 that would raise almost 800 billion a year,11
Joe Biden, the idea that we have companies not paying anything at all they should have a minimum tax of 15 that would raise another 740 billion a year the idea that youre able to have a capital gains tax that you pay at the rate of 20 if you are mike bloomberg or whomever and has a whole lot of money and someone else is paying your staffer is paying at 25 is wrong that would raise another 800 billion we should be rewarding work not just wealth and the american people and the middle class is getting killed and the poor have no way up,11
Elizabeth Warren, can we go back to one thing,11
Lester Holt, all right all right vice president biden thank you chuck,11
Chuck Todd, mayor buttigieg i want to get you in on this because in 2000 you wrote an awardwinning essay you praised senator sanders you specifically praised him for embracing socialism you have now since said that you are concerned about his policies but i am curious about this are you out of touch with your own generation millennials by a big chunk embrace his version of democratic socialism you do not are you out of touch with your generation,11
Pete Buttigieg, no look its true that i was into bernie before it was cool,11
Bernie Sanders, thank you,11
Pete Buttigieg, he was a congressman at the time and the qualities i admired then are qualities i still respect a great deal i never said that i agree with every part of his policy views then or now but i appreciate that at least hes straightforward and honest about it and hes honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than 2900000 to fund his health care plan although again a little bit vague about how the rest of that gap,11
Bernie Sanders, but youre not being honest the premiums would be eliminated,11
Pete Buttigieg, but youre still raising those taxes and when you do it,11
Bernie Sanders, im saving people money because they dont pay any premiums outofpocket expenses copayments or deductibles theyre going to be much better off,11
Pete Buttigieg, but wheres the other 25 trillion supposed to come from at a certain point you got to do the math,11
Bernie Sanders, well weve got it all up there on the internet its a payroll tax,11
Pete Buttigieg, no but even after the payroll tax because you still have a hole,11
Elizabeth Warren, understanding,11
Bernie Sanders, because we have a wealth tax elizabeth has a good one our is a little bit tougher on mr bloomberg than hurts were going to raise it in a progressive way which deals with income and wealth inequality and make certain finally that healthcare in this country is a human right not a privilege,11
Elizabeth Warren, could i ,11
Chuck Todd, 45 seconds senator warren im just going to close it out here you went out of your way to call yourself a capitalist,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes because i am,11
Chuck Todd, to separate yourself from him why,11
Elizabeth Warren, yes because i am look democrats want to beat donald trump but they are worried they are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesnt address the fears of millions of americans across this country who see real problems and want real change they are worried about gambling on a revolution that wont bring along a majority of this country amy and joes hearts are in the right place but we cant be so eager to be liked by mitch mcconnell that we forget how to fight the republicans,11
Amy Klobuchar, seriously elizabeth,11
Elizabeth Warren, mayor buttigieg has been taking money from big donors and changing his positions,11
Pete Buttigieg, thats just not true,11
Elizabeth Warren, so it makes it unclear what it is he stands for other than his own advancement,11
Chuck Todd, okay senator thank you senator klobuchar go ahead youve got this,11
Pete Buttigieg, ill be very clear,11
Chuck Todd, senator klobuchar go ahead youve got the floor for 45 go,11
Amy Klobuchar, thank you number one i have repeatedly said that we have to win big and the way we win big is winning states like nevada but also winning the senate races in arizona and in colorado and beyond and the reason we want to do that is to send mitch mcconnell packing and i think when you look at my history i am the one that has done that i am the one that can lead this ticket and just because i am willing to talk about common ground thats where america is it is not with mitch mcconnell who has 400 bills on his desk that should pass if we get rid of him,11
Elizabeth Warren, may i respond,11
Amy Klobuchar, it is because i am willing to work with people and find common ground,11
Chuck Todd, thank you senator,11
Lester Holt, lets everybody,11
Amy Klobuchar, thats what we want in a president elisabeth,11
Lester Holt, lets catch our breath here,11
Amy Klobuchar, we dont want someone that looks at just plans and different,11
Lester Holt, senator thank you we need to take another break here well return to the paris las vegas in just a moment silence,11
Lester Holt, welcome back to las vegas and the democratic presidential debate to kick off our next round of questioning heres hallie,11
Helen, mayor buttigieg to you in 2018 mayor bloomberg was the biggest outside spender helping democrats running for congress hes also donated billions towards causes like climate change gun safety education if his money wasnt a problem then why is it a problem now,11
Pete Buttigieg, oh i think he should absolutely be doing everything in his power to defeat donald trump i just dont think that has to result in him becoming the president of the united states look our party has values we were built around values like making sure we protect working people but mayor bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage our party has a tradition that includes excellent presidents like barack obama who mayor bloomberg opposed,11
Pete Buttigieg, at the end of the day its not just about how much money youve got its what you stand for and we are living at a moment when americans are so deeply frustrated with the way that both wall street and washington seem to have overlooked our lives the view from the porch of my one house in indiana is that they cant even see us sometimes and if were going into the election of our lives against a president who rose to power by cynically exploited the frustration of ordinary americans feeling like leaders werent speaking to them then i think that turning to someone like mayor bloomberg who thinks he can buy this election is no better a way to succeed than turning to somebody like senator sanders who wants to burn the house down,11
Helen, mr vice president,11
Joe Biden, you know if you  the point of personal privilege used to say it was said that i was in the pocket of mitch mcconnell im the only person on this stage thats beaten mitch mcconnell on four major major cases let me finish let me finish and mitch mcconnell ive been the object of his affection and the presidents affection the way hes gone after me this new republican party after me after my son after my family i dont need to be told im a friend of mitch mcconnells mitch mcconnell has been the biggest pain in my neck in a long long time and so thats number one,11
Joe Biden, number two we have to have somebody who understands what its like for ordinary people ordinary people come up they have to understand like my dad made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs saying i dont have a job honey we have to move you got to move in with grandpa how long it took to buy a house how long it took to get back in the game again they have to understand the needs of ordinary people and they are getting killed no matter what people say about this economy how good it is and the good part of the economy  its only 60 seconds its not up yet and the fact is that were in a situation where you have mayor excuse me the president making clear that he doesnt want any part of me being his opponent hes spending 12500000 this week to keep me from being an opponent i wonder why,11
Helen, thank you mr vice president vanessa to you,11
Elizabeth Warren, can i respond to the vice president please,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you hallie,11
Elizabeth Warren, he was identifying me specifically in that,11
Vanessa Hauc, 45 seconds to you senator warren,11
Joe Biden, i was responding to an accusation,11
Elizabeth Warren, and so no the point is different heres what happened according to the new york times the last time that mitch mcconnell was on the ballot the vice president stood in the oval office and said i hope that mitch gets reelected so i can keep working with him,11
Joe Biden, thats taken totally out of context,11
Elizabeth Warren, well mitch did get did cap reelected he did not have an epiphany instead he blocked really everything that barack obama tried to pass,11
Joe Biden, did you ever win anything,11
Elizabeth Warren, he stole a supreme court seat,11
Joe Biden, come on,11
Elizabeth Warren,  from the democrats the consumer financial protection bureau,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you senator,11
Joe Biden, yeah ,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you senator our next question goes to senator klobuchar about 700000 young people known as dreamers or soñadores who were brought to this country as children are currently protected from deportation because of a program that is now under the review by the supreme court if the court sides with the trump administration which is eager to end this protection what exactly is your plan to protect the dreamers permanently,11
Amy Klobuchar, to win to beat donald trump the best way to protect the dreamers is to have a new president there are the votes there to protect the dreamers and i have been working on this since i got to the united states senate in my first campaign i actually had a bunch of ads run against me because i was standing up for immigrants and when i think of dreamers and i tried to explain it to my state i found a 99yearold hispanic war veteran who was a dreamer when he was brought over to this country and back then he just went to canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen because they needed him to serve in world war ii now not so easy the dreamers are our future the dreamers are so important in nevada and the best way we can get this done is to beat donald trump but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you,11
Amy Klobuchar, which creates a path to citizenship to so many hardworking people who will bring down the deficit by 158 billion and will bring peace for these dreamers,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you so much senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, they know no other country but our own,11
Pete Buttigieg, if youre going to run based on your record of voting in washington then you have to own those votes especially when it comes to immigration you voted to confirm the head of customs and border protection under trump who was one of the architects of the family separation policy you voted to make english the national language do you know the message that sends in as multilingual a state as nevada to immigrants,11
Pete Buttigieg, you have been unusual among democrats i think the democrat among all of the senators running for president most likely to vote for donald trumps judges who we know are especially hostile to dreamers and to the rights of immigrants now in south bend it was not always easy to stand up in a conservative place like indiana on immigration but we delivered we created a municipal id program so that dreamers and others who were undocumented were able to navigate everyday life we stood up for those rights and stood with members of our community with the message that they were as american as we are ,11
Vanessa Hauc, thank you  senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, i wish everyone was as perfect as you pete but let me tell you what its like to be in the arena number one do the math if my friend andrew yang was up here thats what hed say in fact i have opposed not supported twothirds of the trump judges so get your numbers right and i am in the top 10 to 15 of opposing them number two when it comes to immigration reform,11
Amy Klobuchar,  number two when it comes to immigration reform the things that you are referring to that official that you are referring to was supported by about half the democrats including someone in this room i will say this he was highly recommended by the obama officials you know why because trump had so few career people i did not one bit agree with these draconian policies to separate kids from their parents in my first 100 days i would immediately change that,11
Amy Klobuchar, i would add one more thing i have been in the arena,11
Moderator 1, thank you senator,11
Amy Klobuchar,  ted kennedy  he had made a pretty big allegation against me again i think i should have a right to respond he had,11
Pete Buttigieg, im stating the facts because these are votes that you took,11
Amy Klobuchar,  ted kennedy,11
Pete Buttigieg, and those votes set you alone among the democrats running for president,11
Amy Klobuchar, just,11
Pete Buttigieg, no other  is it true or is it false that no other democrat,11
Amy Klobuchar, first of all,11
Pete Buttigieg,  from the senate running for,11
Amy Klobuchar,  it is what youve said about,11
Pete Buttigieg,  president voted that way,11
Amy Klobuchar,  the judges are false you are comparing me to two colleagues up here on this stage and you are forgetting one thing,11
Pete Buttigieg, well i would say for anybody who ran for president this cycle senator harris,11
Amy Klobuchar, you know what pete,11
Pete Buttigieg,  senator booker saw to this,11
Amy Klobuchar, if you could let me finish since ive been in the arena ted kennedy asked me to work on the first immigration bill we were able with president bush to at least get that bill to a vote im sorry but senator sanders actually opposed that bill i worked on it if we had gotten that bill done there would have been a path to citizenship for so many people,11
Amy Klobuchar, then i worked on the 2013 bill im actually so proud of  the work ive done on immigration reform you know what you have not been in the arena doing that work youve memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things but i can tell you one thing what the people of this country want they want a leader that has the heart for the immigrants of this country that is me,11
Pete Buttigieg, maybe leading a diverse city that was facing ruin doesnt sound like the arena to you im used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors but this is the arena too you dont have to be in washington to matter you dont have to be on capital hill,11
Chuck Todd, okay,11
Pete Buttigieg,  for  your work to be significant,11

Pete Buttigieg, the arena is everywhere,11
Chuck Todd, we are at the end here we are at the end here i got to let that one go we are less than two weeks away from a national primary i want to ask all of you this simple question theres a very good chance none of you are going to have enough delegates to the democratic national convention to clinch this nomination okay if that happens i want all of your opinions on this should the person with the most delegates at the end of this primary season be the nominee even if they are short of a majority senator sanders im going to let you go last here because i know your view on this instead i will start with you mayor bloomberg,11
Michael Bloomberg, whatever the rules of the for the democratic party are they should be followed if they have a process which i believe they do,11
Chuck Todd, okay im trying to do this,11
Michael Bloomberg,  so that everybody else,11
Chuck Todd, yes or no you got to make it fast,11
Michael Bloomberg, everybody can,11
Chuck Todd, so you want the convention to work its will,11
Michael Bloomberg, yes,11
Chuck Todd, senator warren,11
Elizabeth Warren, but a convention working its will means that people have the delegates that are pledged to them and they keep those delegates until,11
Chuck Todd, should the leading person,11
Elizabeth Warren,  you come to the convention,11
Chuck Todd, okay,11
Elizabeth Warren, all of the people,11
Chuck Todd, all righty vice president biden,11

Chuck Todd,  senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, let the process work,11
Chuck Todd, senator sanders,11
Bernie Sanders, well the process includes 500 super delegates on the second ballot so i think that,11
Chuck Todd, all right,11
Bernie Sanders,  that the will of the people should prevail,11
Chuck Todd, okay,11
Bernie Sanders, yes,11
Chuck Todd,  thank you guys,11

Chuck Todd, five nos and a yes,11
Lester Holt, we are not done yet were back with more from las vegas after a short break,11
Lester Holt, silence,11
Lester Holt, welcome back everyone it is time for closing statements each candidate will have one minute and we begin with senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, this has been quite a debate what i want everyone out there watching to remember is that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us that we need a candidate that can bring people with her yes a fired up democratic base but also independents and moderate republicans ive done that every single time i have won every race down to fourth grade a lot of boasting up here so i thought id add that,11
Amy Klobuchar, secondly you need someone who can govern i have passed over 100 bills as the lead democrat,11
Amy Klobuchar, third you need someone that has the heart to be the president they were talking a lot about heart conditions up here we have a president right now that doesnt have a heart i love the people of this country i ask for the vote of the people of nevada because this state gets it they get that maybe you dont agree with every single thing thats said on this debate stage but we understand that the heart of america is bigger than any heart,11
Lester Holt, senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar,  that guy has in the white house,11
Lester Holt, senator klobuchar,11
Amy Klobuchar, i ask you to join me at amyklobucharcom,11
Lester Holt, senator thank you,11
Amy Klobuchar, thank you,11
Moderator 1, mayor bloomberg to you,11
Michael Bloomberg, well you can join me at mikebloombergcom too if you want but im not asking for any money,11
Michael Bloomberg, look this is a management job and donald trumps not a manager this is a job where you have to build teams he doesnt have a team so he goes and makes decisions without knowing whats going on or the implications of what he does we can not run the railroad this way this country has to pull together and understand that the people that we elect and its not just the president of the united states they should have experience they should have credentials they should understand what theyre doing and the implications thereof then we should as a society try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters if they havent done the job we shouldnt just say oh nice person gives a good speech we should say didnt do the job and youre out of here,11
Moderator 1, mr mayor thank you,11
Lester Holt, mayor buttigieg one minute,11
Pete Buttigieg, well nevada im asking for your vote because america is running out of time this is our only chance to defeat donald trump if you look at the choice between a revolution or the status quo and you dont see where you fit in that picture then join us yes go for peteforamericacom and help out because we need to draw everybody that we can who believes that we need to empower workers who believes in climate science who believes in doing something about gun violence and recognizes that the only way we can do this is to create a sense of belonging in this country that moves us out of the toxic and polarized moment that we are living in today,11
Pete Buttigieg, i already see an american majority ready to do these things now we have a responsibility to galvanize not polarize that majority we can not afford to lean on the same washington playbook we can not afford to alienate half the country we must step forward into the future in order to win and in order to govern a country that will be facing issues the likes of which we barely thought of just a few years ago,11
Lester Holt, mr mayor,11
Pete Buttigieg, im asking you to join me,11
Lester Holt,  thank you,11
Pete Buttigieg,  so that we can deliver that future together,11
Moderator 4, senator warren your turn,11
Elizabeth Warren, i grew up fighting i grew up out in oklahoma and i learned it probably from my mother i watched when my daddy had a heart attack and didnt have any money coming in when our car was lost and when we were on the edge of losing our home i watched my mother fight to save our family i grew up fighting to save our family my family i eventually made it through school and spent my life as a teacher looking into why it is that so many families across this country are struggling and why it gets worse year after year after year,11
Elizabeth Warren, i for years have fought for unions to say the way were going to restructure this economy is were going to make it easier to join a union and get more power into unions to fight for students who have been cut out of opportunity over and over because of the rising cost of an education,11
Elizabeth Warren, look for me i am  of all the people on this stage ive been a politician the shortest time but ive been the one out fighting for families the longest time i promise you this give me a chance ill go to the white house and ill fight for your family,11
Moderator 4, thank you senator,11
Chuck Todd, vice president biden,11
Joe Biden, im running because so many people,11
Audience, ,11
Bernie Sanders, just continue ,11
Audience,  we dont want,11
Lester Holt,  please give us a moment well clear the room and let the,11
Audience, ,11
Lester Holt, and let,11
Audience, ,11
Lester Holt, senator biden you have one minute,11
Joe Biden, look im running because so many people are being left behind people i grew up with in scranton when my job lost his job lost his house had to move we moved to claymont and we found ourselves in a position where we had little ability to get anything done my dad worked like hell i learned a lot ive been knocked down a whole hell of a lot i know what its like to be knocked down but i know we have to get back up we have to provide some safety and security for the american people,11
Joe Biden, right here in nevada the site of the most significant mass murder in american history guns our kids are getting sent to school having to hide under desks learn how to run down corridors to avoid being shot its immoral im the only one thats beating the nra nationally and ive beat them twice,11
Joe Biden, with regard to healthcare it also is something that isnt right obamacare has to be expanded it can be in fact cover everybody,11
Joe Biden, lastly i think its important that on day one we deal with sending an immigration bill to the desk the only person in here has the worst record on immigration is bernie because bernie voted against the 2007 bill,11
Lester Holt, all right,11
Moderator 1, thank you,11
Joe Biden, had in fact that,11
Moderator 1,  thank you thank you,11
Joe Biden,  immigration bill passed,11
Moderator 1, thank you mr vice president,11
Joe Biden,  there would be 10  six million members would be,11
Lester Holt, okay,11
Joe Biden,  now american citizens,11
Lester Holt, all right senator sanders you have one minute for your closing argument,11
Bernie Sanders, unfortunately rulac among other groups latino groups saw that bill having provisions akin to slavery joe but the bottom line is all of us are united in defeating the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country that we agree on,11
Bernie Sanders, but where we dont agree i think is why we are today the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people why three people own more wealth than the bottom half of america when 500000 people sleep out on the street why hundreds of thousands of bright young kids cant afford to go to college and 45 million remain in student debt,11
Bernie Sanders, bottom line here real change never takes place from the top on down never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires we need to mobilize millions of people to stand up for justice thats our campaign join us at berniesanderscom thank you,11
Lester Holt, senator thank you folks thank you that concludes tonights debate our thanks to my fellow moderators to the candidates and of course to all of you the audience here and at home the nevada caucuses are this saturday with the south carolina primary just one week later then the big prize super tuesday on march 3rd well be following it all for you,11
Lester Holt, for now for all of us at nbc news im lester holt good day,11
Norah O’Donnell, good evening and welcome the democratic presidential primary here in south carolina the first primary in the south is just four days away,12
Gayle King, and super tuesday is just a week away and this is the biggest primary day of the year as voters in 14 states cast ballots and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind so this debate when you think about it tonight may be the last best chance for the candidates to make their case to south carolina and super tuesday voters,12
Norah O’Donnell, and cbs news is proud to bring you this debate along with our cosponsors they are the democratic national committee and the congressional black caucus institute a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders,12
Gayle King, and we are partnering tonight also with twitter so you at home can participate in this debate how do you do that send us your questions for the candidates using the twitter hashtag demdebate,12
Norah O’Donnell, now here are the rules for the next two hours when you were asked a question you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer and 45 seconds for followups so lets begin senator sanders we havent had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years here in south carolina the unemployment rate is even lower how will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than president trump with the economy,12
Bernie Sanders, well youre right the economy is doing really great for people like mr bloomberg and other billionaires in the last three years last three years billionaires in this country saw an 850 billion increase in their wealth but you know what for the ordinary american things are not so good last year real wage increases for the average worker were less than one percent half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck 87 million americans have no health insurance or are underinsured 45 million people are struggling with student debt 500000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street including 30000 veterans that is not an economy thats working for the american people thats an economy working for the one percent were going to create an economy for all not just wealthy campaign contributors,12
Mike Bloomberg, senator,12
Norah O’Donnell, mayor bloomberg ill let you respond to that do you think senator sanders economy would be better for america than president trump,12
Mike Bloomberg, i think that donald trump thinks it would be better if hes president i do not think so vladimir putin thinks that donald trump should be president of the united states and thats why russia is helping you get elected so you lose to him,12
Bernie Sanders, oh mr bloomberg let me tell mr putin okay im not a good friend of president xi of china i think president xi is an authoritarian leader and let me tell mr putin who interfered in the 2016 election try to bring americans against americans hey mr putin if im president of the united states trust me youre not going to interfere in anymore american elections,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator warren,12
Pete Buttigieg, we know what the president  what russia wants its chaos,12
Elizabeth Warren, look the way i see this is that bernie is winning right now because the democratic party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas even if there are a lot of people on this stage who dont want to say so but bernie and i agree on a lot of things but i think i would make a better president than bernie and the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and its going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen bernie and i both wanted to help reign in wall street in 2008 we both got our chance but i dug in i fought the big banks i built the coalitions and i won bernie and i both want to see universal healthcare but bernies plan doesnt explain how to get there doesnt show how were going to get enough allies into it and doesnt show enough about how were going to pay for it,12
Elizabeth Warren, i dug in i did the work and then bernies team trashed me for it we need a president who is going to dig in do the hard work and actually get it done progressives have got one shot and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done,12
Gayle King, mayor buttigieg we want to bring you in his conversation why would the russians to be working on behalf of bernie sanders,12
Pete Buttigieg, ill tell you what the russians want they dont have a political party they want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way i mean look if you think the last four years has been chaotic divisive toxic exhausting imagine spending the better part of 2020 with bernie sanders versus donald trump think about what that will be like for this country and meanwhile folks at home from south carolina to south bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us because its right that there is a progressive majority an american majority that wants to see real change wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement but also theres the majority of the american people who i think right now just to be able to turn on the tv see their president and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof we have an opportunity to set a different tone,12
Norah O’Donnell, mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, bernie sanders analysis is right the difference is i dont like his solutions i dont believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families i think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed the answers not for the government to take over the private sector though the answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again,12
Norah O’Donnell, vice president biden,12
Tom Steyer, well let me just finish because we need to have an alternative to donald trump im talking about doubling the minimum wage cutting taxes by 10 for everybody who makes less than 250000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs donald trump stinks hes incompetent as a steward of the american economy we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy  that works for american working people,12
Gayle King, mr steyer thank you your times up vice president biden,12
Joe Biden, we talk about progressive lets talk about being progressive walking distance here is mother emanuel church nine people shot dead by a white supremacist bernie voted five times against the brady bill and monitored a waiting period  no let me finish a waiting period of 12 hours im not saying hes responsible for the nine deaths but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what i suggest until you are cleared in addition to that being progressive he thought barack obama he wanted a primary he said we should primary barack obama someone should and in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it look folks lets talk about progressive progressive is getting things done and thats what we got done we got a lot done,12
Gayle King, senator sanders your response,12
Bernie Sanders, pete mentioned  im hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight i wonder why and maybe pete mentions what the american people want i will tell you pete what the american people want and joe what the american people want they dont want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding,12
Pete Buttigieg, lets clear this up once and for all,12
Bernie Sanders, pete has gotten funding ,12
Pete Buttigieg, i cant allow this to stand because its just not true senator sanders has got people believing  something that is untrue about my campaign the idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires,12
Bernie Sanders, i didnt say that pete,12
Pete Buttigieg, 50 people all right in charleston alone just in charleston over 2000 people have contributed to my campaign that means the dollars that have come to my campaign just from charleston is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned grassroots contributions are the lifeblood of my campaign in fact i shouldnt miss the opportunity if youre watching right now and you support my campaign go to peteforamericacom and chip in and if youre watching right now and youre a billionaire i will raise your taxes but if youd like to defeat donald trump please go to peteforamericacom and donate the legal maximum of 2800 if youre a billionaire,12
Gayle King, all right mayor buttigieg vice president biden i want to bring us to another topic were in south carolina its the first primary with a significant black voting population your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters and im wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time,12
Joe Biden, well first of all the latest poll i saw my numbers im still 15 points ahead the latest poll,12
Gayle King, yes yes youre correct,12
Joe Biden, but look,12
Gayle King, but senator sanders is in striking distance of you you are within the margin of error in this state,12
Joe Biden, well it depends on which  look ive earned the vote ive worked like the devil to earn the vote of the african american community not just here but across the country ive been coming here for years and years creating jobs here making sure that the port for example that employs one in 11 people we put 500 million in our administration just into this county weve created jobs for people the people know me my entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties i dont expect anything i plan to earn the vote im here to ask  but folks i intend to win south carolina and i will win the african american vote here in south carolina,12
Gayle King, mr biden will you continue if you do not win south carolina you have said that south carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race if you dont win south carolina will you continue,12
Joe Biden, i will win south carolina,12
Gayle King, all right sir mayor bloomberg id like to bring you in this conversation i want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community youve apologized for stopandfrisk repeatedly what exactly are you apologizing for,12
Mike Bloomberg, we let it get out of control and when i realized that i cut it back by 95 and ive apologized and asked for forgiveness ive met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of,12
Mike Bloomberg,  ive met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how i can better position myself and what i should have done and what i should do next time but let me tell you i have been working very hard weve improved the school system for black and brown students in new york city weve increased the jobs that are available to them weve increased the housing thats available to them we have programs like the,12
Gayle King, but what more can you do about this issue mr mayor to put peoples fears and skepticism to rest,12
Mike Bloomberg, i think they just,12
Gayle King, it continues to follow you,12
Mike Bloomberg, no well thats because its in their interest to promote that but if you talk to the people in new york city i have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me a lot of them are in the audience tonight and ive earned the respect of people in new york city i was the mayor of the largest most populous city in the united states for 12 years and people will tell you its a lot better city today it is safer for everybody the school system is better the budgets under control weve done the things that people need in new york city for all ethnicities,12
Gayle King, mayor buttigieg mayor to mayor youve certainly had your issues with the black community as well do you think the new york citys implementation of stop and frisk was racist,12
Pete Buttigieg, yes in effect it was because it was about profiling people based on their race and the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little and im not here to score points i come at this with a great deal of humility because we have had a lot of issues especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community,12
Pete Buttigieg, and i come to this with some humility because im conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice none of us have the experience the lived experience of for example walking down the street or in a mall and feeling eyes on us regarding us as dangerous without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin none of us have the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by of going into a doctor and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you mayor,12
Pete Buttigieg, since we dont have the experience the next best thing,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you mayor,12
Pete Buttigieg,  we can do is actually listen to those who do,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you im going to get to ,12
Mike Bloomberg, wait a second i know that if i were black my success would have been a lot harder to achieve and i know a lot of black people that if they were white it wouldve been a lot easier for them thats just a fact and weve got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator klobuchar was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist,12
Amy Klobuchar, yes and i think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where were going to go forward martin luther king once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly so when there is racism in the criminal justice system then we need to fix it and to me that means sentencing reform like the first step act and extending that to the states with the second step act,12
Amy Klobuchar, it means equal opportunity because if we dont pass representative clyburns bill out of south carolina here to invest in impoverished communities were never going to get to that single garment of destiny,12
Amy Klobuchar, and we also need to do something about child care about making sure we increase the minimum wage and then finally voting while we are all sitting here debating wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator,12
Amy Klobuchar,  of people off of their voting rolls,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator,12
Amy Klobuchar, georgia kicked 100000 off as president,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Amy Klobuchar,  i will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator gayle,12
Gayle King, senator warren im coming to you i want to direct this question to you because mayor bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesnt believe that any of you on stage can beat donald trump you said mayor bloomberg is not the safest candidate he is the riskiest candidate what did you mean by that,12
Elizabeth Warren, i mean that mayor bloomberg  lets think of it this way were here in charleston and you know whos going to be in charleston later this week is donald trump hes going to be here to raise money for his buddy senator lindsey graham who funded lindsey grahams campaign for reelection last time it was mayor bloomberg,12
Elizabeth Warren, and thats not the only rightwing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded in 2016 he dumped 12 million into the pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an antichoice rightwing republican senator and i just want to say the woman challenger was terrific she lost by a single point in 2012 he scooped in to try to defend another republican senator against a woman challenger that was me it didnt work but he tried hard,12
Elizabeth Warren, i dont care how much money mayor bloomberg has the core of the democratic party will never trust him he has not earned their trust i will and the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage,12
Gayle King, all right senator warren thank you mayor bloomberg would you like to respond mayor bloomberg,12
Mike Bloomberg, i have been training for this job since i stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 911 i know what to do ive shown i know how to run a country ive run the city which is almost the same size  is bigger than most countries in the world im the one choice that makes some sense i have the experience i have the resources and i have the record and all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that when people hired me to run new york city three times in an overwhelmingly democratic progressive city they elected me again and again,12
Norah O’Donnell, mr vice president,12
Elizabeth Warren, i was mentioned in this,12
Joe Biden, no,12
Elizabeth Warren, id like to respond,12
Joe Biden, there was a,12
Norah O’Donnell, go ahead senator,12
Elizabeth Warren, he called me out by name in this,12
Joe Biden, there was a  i thought,12
Elizabeth Warren,  and referred to what i talk about as a sideshow this is personal for me when i was 21 years old i got my first job as a special education teacher i loved that job and by the end of the first year i was visibly pregnant the principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else pregnancy discrimination you bet but i was 21 years old i didnt have a union to protect me and i didnt have any federal law on my side so i packed up my stuff and i went home at least i didnt have a boss who said to me kill it the way that mayor bloomberg,12
Mike Bloomberg, never said that,12
Elizabeth Warren,  is alleged to have said,12
Mike Bloomberg, oh come one,12
Elizabeth Warren,  to one of his pregnant employees people want a chance,12
Mike Bloomberg, that,12
Elizabeth Warren, people want a chance,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator,12
Elizabeth Warren,  to hear from the women who have worked for mayor bloomberg,12
Mike Bloomberg, i never said that,12
Norah O’Donnell, i want to allow the mayor  to respond,12
Mike Bloomberg, and for the record if she was a teacher in new york city she would never have had that problem we treated our teachers the right way and the unions will tell you exactly that,12
Norah O’Donnell, well mayor bloomberg senator warren has raised,12
Elizabeth Warren, then let us have  the women have an opportunity to speak the bloomberg corporations and mayor bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination they are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak if he says there is nothing to hide here then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out,12
Amy Klobuchar, hey no,12
Elizabeth Warren,  so that they can tell their stories,12
Pete Buttigieg, ,12
Elizabeth Warren,  the way i can tell my story without,12
Amy Klobuchar, norah,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you i,12
Elizabeth Warren,  having the fear,12
Amy Klobuchar, norah,12
Elizabeth Warren,  that theyre going to be sued by a billionaire,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you thank you we have a number of issues to discuss tonight but i want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace at the last debate you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes did these women take your jokes wrong or were you wrong to make the jokes,12
Mike Bloomberg, probably wrong to make the jokes i dont remember what they were so i assume if it bothered them i was wrong and i apologize im sorry for that but what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two and what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement i did that two days later and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again the senator has got it and i dont know what else she wants us to do,12
Elizabeth Warren, oh ill be clear,12
Mike Bloomberg, were following exactly what she asked to do,12
Elizabeth Warren, ill tell you exactly what i want you to do,12
Mike Bloomberg, and the trouble is with this senator enough is never enough for what this  im going to start focusing on some of these other things we just cannot continue to relitigate this every time we did what she asked and thank you weve probably made the world better because of it and by my company renouncing using these we probably changed hopefully the corporate landscape all across america,12
Elizabeth Warren, no im sorry mr mayor,12
Pete Buttigieg, if you get nominated well be relitigating this all year,12
Elizabeth Warren,  you did not do what i asked,12
Gayle King, senator warren that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor,12
Elizabeth Warren, yes,12
Gayle King, he told a woman to get an abortion what evidence do you have of that,12
Elizabeth Warren, her own words,12
Gayle King, and mayor bloomberg could you respond to this,12
Mike Bloomberg, i,12
Elizabeth Warren, this is,12
Mike Bloomberg,  never said it period end of story,12
Elizabeth Warren, look,12
Mike Bloomberg, categorically never said it when i was accused of doing it we couldnt figure out what she was talking about but right now im sorry if she heard what she thought she heard or whatever happened i didnt take any pleasure in that and weve just got to go on but i never said it come on,12
Gayle King, all right,12
Elizabeth Warren, what i asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims,12
Mike Bloomberg, we are doing that senator,12
Elizabeth Warren, who have discrimination claims,12
Amy Klobuchar, norah norah,12
Elizabeth Warren,  against the mayor,12
Norah O’Donnell, we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the democratic party,12
Elizabeth Warren, okay,12
Bernie Sanders, good,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, thank you,12
Norah O’Donnell,  the cost of your agenda yesterday you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals but not all of your details are clear you proposed more than  50 trillion in new spending youve said medicare for all,12
Bernie Sanders, over a 10year period,12
Norah O’Donnell,  will cost 30 trillion but you can only explain how youll pay for just about half of that can you do the math for the rest of us,12
Bernie Sanders, how many hours do you have,12
Gayle King, two,12
Bernie Sanders, the answer is,12
Joe Biden, thats the problem,12
Bernie Sanders, no thats not the problem all right lets talk about medicare for all im sure youre familiar with the new study that just came out of yale university published in lancet magazine one of the prestigious medical journals in the world you know what it said medicare for all will lower healthcare costs in this country by 450 billion a year and save 68000 lives of people who otherwise would have died,12
Bernie Sanders, what we need to do is to do what every other major country on earth does guarantee healthcare to all people not have thousands of separate insurance plans which are costing us some 500 billion a year to administer our plan we have laid out options all over the place one of the options is a sevenandahalfpercent payroll tax on employers which will save them substantial sums of money another tax,12
Amy Klobuchar, bernie let me respond to this,12
Pete Buttigieg, we can do the math right now,12
Bernie Sanders, you asked me a question,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator klobuchar does the math add up,12
Amy Klobuchar, no the math does not add up in fact just on 60 minutes this weekend he said he wasnt going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes well let me tell you how many nickels and dimes were ,12
Amy Klobuchar, the nickels and the dimes well let me tell you how many nickels and dimes were talking about nearly 60 trillion do you know how much that is for all of his programs that is three times the american economy not the federal government the entire american economy the medicare for all plan alone page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years that is true as one prominent democrat once said we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are bernie that prominent democrat was barack obama a few months ago and i think thats what we should do they are not with you on spending nearly 60 trillion,12
Bernie Sanders, first of all,12
Amy Klobuchar, what i think we should do is make things more affordable nonprofit public option make sure were paying for longterm care better take on the pharmaceuticals like you and i have done together,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator,12
Amy Klobuchar, and do something for the people of america,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator klobuchar,12
Amy Klobuchar, instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers,12
Bernie Sanders, i think that shes talking about me,12
Norah O’Donnell, mr steyer mr steyer,12
Pete Buttigieg, i think were talking about math,12
Norah O’Donnell, we will get to you mr sanders,12
Pete Buttigieg, lets talk about it,12
Tom Steyer, let me can i say something,12
Bernie Sanders, look first of all,12
Tom Steyer, wait a minute let me go let me go,12
Bernie Sanders, i think tom i think she was talking about my plan not yours,12
Pete Buttigieg, i think we were talking about math and it doesnt take two hours to do the math because lets talk about what it adds up to,12
Bernie Sanders, lets talk about math,12
Pete Buttigieg, lets talk about math indeed,12
Bernie Sanders, lets talk about math,12
Pete Buttigieg, okay so heres the math,12
Bernie Sanders, doing nothing is what  excuse me can i respond to the attack,12
Pete Buttigieg, doing nothing is what will happen,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders you are allowed a quick response,12
Tom Steyer, excuse me i was called on,12
Norah O’Donnell, then we would like to allow the other candidates,12
Pete Buttigieg, nothing is what will happen if we put forward a candidate,12
Bernie Sanders, the moderator guys,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, the moderator  is it my turn,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders you have been name checked you are allowed to respond,12
Bernie Sanders, okay what the health and human services have said in analyzing healthcare costs what recent yale study has said is that your program would cost some 50 trillion over a 10 year period we would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs what every study out there conservative or progressive says medicare for all will save money ours will cost about 45 billion not 60 trillion ,12
Gayle King, senator sanders we would like to bring mr steyer in on this conversation mr steyer please,12
Amy Klobuchar, i was talking about all your programs,12
Tom Steyer, excuse me amy this conversation shows a huge risk for the democratic party we are looking at a party that has decided that were either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a republican and let me say that i got into this race because i wanted to fight for economic justice for racial justice and to make sure we had climate justice for the american people and i am scared if we cannot pull this party together if we go to one of those extremes we take a terrible risk of reelecting donald trump,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, and that is something  i still have some time and let me just say this,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, that is a risk that will hurt the american people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you lets keep this topic going mayor pete,12
Pete Buttigieg, so lets do some math senator sanders at one point said it was going to be 40 trillion then it was 30 then it was 17 its an incredible shrinking price tag at some point has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be now there are new numbers ill tell you exactly what it adds up to it adds up to four more years of donald trump kevin mccarthy is speaker of the house and the inability to get the senate into democratic hands the time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters not only is this a way to get donald trump reelected we got a house to worry about we got a senate to worry about and this really important,12
Bernie Sanders, hello,12
Pete Buttigieg, if you want to keep the house in democratic hands you might want to check with the people who actually turned the house blue 40 democrats who are not running on your platform,12
Joe Biden, 41,12
Pete Buttigieg, they are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can i want to send those democrats back to the united states house,12
Gayle King, times up mr mayor vice president biden,12
Pete Buttigieg, lets listen to them,12
Gayle King, vice president biden please,12
Pete Buttigieg, when they say that they dont want to be out there defending senator sanders,12
Joe Biden, whoa whoa whoa,12
Gayle King, vice president biden please,12
Joe Biden, i guess the only way to do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should heres the deal heres the deal look a guy is a friend of mine down there named fritz hollings the pastor he said you want to know what a man or woman will do look what theyve done look what theyve done you talk about concerns about race well my good friend on the end of this platform he in fact bought a system that was a private prison system after he knew that in fact what happened was they hogtied young men in prison here in this state they in fact made sure that in georgia they did not have health care for the people who were being held they in fact went on and he said after he knew that he bought it and then he said he was proud of his accomplishment you talk about what were talking about with bernie bernie in fact hasnt passed much of anything the fact of the matter is,12
Tom Steyer, okay but i get to answer that i get to answer that,12
Joe Biden, look the fact is,12
Tom Steyer, theyre out of time and i get to answer,12
Joe Biden, im not out of time you spoke overtime and im going to talk heres the deal heres the deal the fact of the matter is look at whats happening here look at whats happening here we have to win the senate back and by the way i went into all of those races that got 41 new democrats the majority of them are supporting me for president,12
Norah O’Donnell, mr president i have to allow yes mr mayor,12
Tom Steyer, wait a second,12
Norah O’Donnell, mr mayor youre allowed to respond,12
Tom Steyer, i bought stock in a prison company thinking theyd do a better job and i investigated and i sold it,12
Joe Biden, but you knew you knew when you bought it they had done that,12
Tom Steyer, i get to answer this question and in fact since then ive worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state and weve ended it ive started a bank to support black ownership of businesses women ownership of businesses and latino owners of businesses because this financial service industry is prejudice i have worked tirelessly on this and you know im right you wrote the crime bill that you call,12
Joe Biden, where we come from thats called tommy come lately,12
Tom Steyer, the joe biden crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and latino men in prison,12
Mike Bloomberg, okay let me say something,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Tom Steyer, theres something going on here,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, i have worked for racial justice completely and that is an absolute unfair statement,12
Amy Klobuchar, all i know,12
Joe Biden, tommy come lately,12
Amy Klobuchar, if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart were going to watch donald trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart,12
Joe Biden, look,12
Amy Klobuchar, so my argument here is that we need to get back to whats happening right now we have a clear choice of whos going to lead this party and i am the only one in the new hampshire debate when asked if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket that raise my hand i like bernie we came in together to the senate but i do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket and if you want to talk about getting things done and come make a comparison according to vanderbilt university in tennessee last congress i was the most effective democrat in the us senate on 15 metrics bernie and elizabeth were in the bottom half it matters it matters if you can actually get things done it is not just who talks to the best who actually gets things done and especially with the african american community there have been a lot of broken promises and i think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for this people matters ,12
Gayle King, mayor bloomberg please,12
Mike Bloomberg, lets just go on the record they talk about 40 democrats 21 of those were people that i spent 100 million to help elect all of the new democrats that came in and put nancy pelosi in charge and gave the congress the ability to control this president i got them number two when you talk about money lets put this in perspective the federal budget is four and a half trillion dollars a year we get three and a half trillion dollars in revenue we lose 1 trillion a year thats why the federal budget deficit is  right now the debt is 20 trillion going up to 21 we just cannot afford some of the stuff people talk about but if you  let me finish if you keep on going we will elect bernie bernie will lose to donald trump and donald trump and the house and the senate and some of the state houses will all go red and then between gerrymandering and appointing judges for the next 20 or 30 years were going to live with this catastrophe,12
Norah O’Donnell, mayor bloomberg thank you i will allow senator sanders a quick response and then senator warren,12
Bernie Sanders, thank you very much norah,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders a quick response and then senator,12
Bernie Sanders, thank you very much mayor bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support problem is theyre all billionaires if you look  on the other hand of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally mr bloomberg i beat trump 47 of those 50 times if you look at battleground states like michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania polling just done,12
Mike Bloomberg, the polls arent the election,12
Bernie Sanders, i beat trump and if you want to be trump what youre going to need is an unprecedented grassroots movement of black and white and latino native american and asian people that was standing up and fighting for justice,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Bernie Sanders, thats what our movement is about,12
Mike Bloomberg, can anybody in the room imagine moderate republicans going over and voting for him,12
Bernie Sanders, absolutely,12
Mike Bloomberg, and you have to that or you cant win,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator warren,12
Elizabeth Warren, that is the problem and that is that a progressive agenda is popular mayor bloomberg and for everyone on this stage we talk about how to build a future thats what matters i talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on healthcare its why i also have a way to pay for healthcare that doesnt raise taxes on middleclass families but its so much more than that as democrats we need to speak to the future we can build together we need to speak to the prosperity we can build together how about a wealth tax in america because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one 10th of 1 we have a chance to invest in universal childcare for every one of our babies to really level the playing field put 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million americans we need to talk about our aspirations our hopes this is a moment to choose hope over fear,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator thank you,12
Elizabeth Warren, this is our moment,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator thank you we have to take a quick break when we come back the democratic presidential debate continues right after this only on cbs,12
Gayle King, im gayle king with norah odonnell joining us now on the questions here in charleston south carolina are our cbs news colleagues the a team bill whitaker of 60 minutes chief washington correspondent thats major garrett and margaret brennan moderator of face the nation were going to begin with you vice president biden for this part just across the street as you mentioned at the top of the debate is a theater where nine people were shot and killed inside the mother emanuel church we all remember that day back in 2015 and every day in our country over 100 people die from gun violence you all have plans i know on this stage to address the gun crisis but congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century and just think about this in those 25 years weve had columbine newtown parkland las vegas we could go on and on vice president biden i want to start with you why should anyone have faith that youre the one who can get this done now,12
Joe Biden, because im the only one that ever got it done nationally i beat the nra twice i got assault weapons banned i got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them i got them eliminated except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in florida and it was not reauthorized in addition to that i passed the brady bill with waiting periods i led that fight but my friend on my right and others have in fact also given to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity imagine if i stood here and said we give immunity to drug companies we give immunity to tobacco companies that has caused carnage on our streets 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability more than all the wars including vietnam from that point on carnage on our street and i want to tell you if im elected nra im coming for you and gun manufacturers im going to take you on and im going to beat you im the only one whos done it,12
Pete Buttigieg, thats why weve got to change what washington can deliver,12
Elizabeth Warren, yes this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really its going to take to get something done ive been in the senate when ive seen gun safety legislation introduced get a majority and then doesnt pass because of the filibuster understand this the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry it gives a veto to the oil industry its going to give a veto on immigration until were willing to dig in and say that if mitch mcconnell is going to do to the next democratic president what he did to president obama and that is try to block every single thing he does that we are willing to roll back the filibuster go with a majority vote and do what needs to be done for the american people,12
Gayle King, thank you senator were going to stay on this topic and allow senator,12
Joe Biden, okay but  votes to change that were going to beat mitch mcconnell,12
Gayle King, thank you,12
Elizabeth Warren, understand this many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster,12
Gayle King, time senator thank you time senator,12
Elizabeth Warren, until were ready to do that we cant make real change,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator i want to allow senator sanders to respond because youve gone after the insurance industry youve taken on pharmaceutical companies and youve taken on big tech why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass,12
Bernie Sanders, you know joe has voted for terrible trade agreements no no no no no joe voted for the war in iraq my point was  not to be  i have cast thousands of votes including bad votes that was a bad vote i have today a d minus voting record from the nra 30 years ago i likely lost a race for the one seat for congress in vermont because 30 years ago i supported a ban on assault weapons,12
Joe Biden, and ,12
Bernie Sanders, 30 years ago right now my view is we need to expand background checks and the gun show loophole and do what the american people want not what the nra wants,12
Pete Buttigieg, okay but wait a second  the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago,12
Mike Bloomberg, time out i think she recognized me thank you i have a six million person organization around this country moms demand action in every town we have put background checks weve got background checks in 20 states so you can do it its congress that cant seem to do it and i dont know why we think theyre going to do it the vice president voted for a death bill and supported the nra and certainly sanders has supported the nra but we can do this we just got to stop talking about it they want it both ways,12
Amy Klobuchar, but the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually need the votes so i have long supported the assault weapon ban i am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers cant go out and get an ak47,12
Joe Biden, i wrote that law,12
Amy Klobuchar, that bill along with  you didnt write that bill,12
Joe Biden, i did write that i wrote the bill the violence against women act that took,12
Amy Klobuchar, okay you did that,12
Joe Biden,  out of the hands of people who abused or,12
Amy Klobuchar, okay well have a fact check look at this,12
Joe Biden,  wait no lets look at the fact check,12
Amy Klobuchar,  oh my goodness,12
Joe Biden, the only thing that the boyfriend loophole was not covered i couldnt get that covered you in fact as a senator tried to get it covered and mitch mcconnell is holding up on his desk right now and were going to lose the violence against women act across the board,12
Amy Klobuchar, okay so if i could finish i have the bill  anyone can check it out  to close the boyfriend loophole also to close the charleston loophole is another bill thats out there universal background checks but let me say how we win this weve got to win in the middle of the country and while everyone talks about winning rural areas suburban areas im the only one up here with the receipts that has actually repeatedly while being for the assault weapon ban won in republican congressional districts over and over again including michele bachmanns district so having someone that can lead the ticket that can bring people with her is the way you get gun safety legislation i look at these proposals and say do they hurt my uncle dick in the deer stand they do not so coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key,12
Gayle King, senator klobuchar thank you we want to allow many people to get on this topic mayor buttigieg,12
Pete Buttigieg, im definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country but i want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long ago bad vote that bernie sanders took this is a current bad position that bernie sanders holds and were in south carolina how are we going to deliver a revolution if you wont even support a rule change we are in the state where strom thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly no less a senate traditional figure than harry reed has called for it to go it has got to go because otherwise washington will not deliver i was in high school when the columbine shooting happened and i remember everybody in washington saying never again well never let this happen again and then a second school shooting generation has now been produced shame on us if we allow there to be a third,12
Gayle King,  times up mayor buttigieg times up sir,12
Pete Buttigieg, in terms of making the case i think it wouldnt be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate from the perspective of a veteran why the kinds of weaponry anything remotely like what i trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an american school or church or neighbor,12
Gayle King, all right senator sanders please,12
Bernie Sanders, 30 years ago supported a ban on assault weapons mike bloomberg has thought it a very good organization moms demand action congratulations they have credit me with gun sense as you,12
Mike Bloomberg, yes we did,12
Bernie Sanders,  furthermore furthermore it is my view that the time is now and joe made this point look at the end of the day we need to rally the america people here is the good news because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings the american people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety not be dictated to by the nra and i am proud that i have a d minus voting record from the nra if elected president it will get worse than that,12
Gayle King, all right mr steyer please mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, it isnt a question of the american people deciding that we have too much gun violence everyone in america knows we have too much gun violence the problem we have is that corporations have bought washington dc the gun manufacturers own the senate of the united states so even though over 90 of americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase we cant get it through the senate,12
Tom Steyer, so the question you have to ask yourself is how do we change the senate of the united states in a material way and there are two things thats why i am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator to change whos in charge to get rid of mitch mcconnell and lindsey graham and ted cruz but i am also  senator sanders is right we need to win a huge victory across the board,12
Gayle King, all right mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, democrats need to go to the grassroots i built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the united states,12
Gayle King, your times up sir,12
Tom Steyer, the way to win at the grassroots is tell the truth,12
Gayle King, your times up sir,12
Tom Steyer,  and organize,12
Gayle King, bill whitaker,12
Tom Steyer, thats what its going to take in 2020,12
Gayle King, your times up sir bill whitaker,12
Bill Whitaker, lets talk about education south carolinas schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment black students here consistently score worse than white students mayor bloomberg a key element of your response to failing schools in new york city was a dramatic increase in public charter schools as president would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide,12
Mike Bloomberg, im not sure theyre appropriate every place i can only tell you in new york they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them the charter schools are mixed in with the noncharter public schools because our charter schools are public schools as well theyve helped each other saw a statistic the other day when i came into office zero new york city schools were in the top 25 of the state when i left 23 out of 25 were from new york city weve cut the gap between the rich and the poor weve made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have i raised teachers salaries by 43 i put an extra 5 billion into our school system i value education it is the only ways to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education and rather than just talk about it in new york we actually did it,12
Bill Whitaker, senator warren,12
Gayle King, senator warren,12
Elizabeth Warren, so this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself and im going to start with my secretary of education my secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school my secretary of education will was someone who believes in public education and my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools one more thing my secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high stakes testing we need to support our children but look we want to build a future in this country we build a future by investing in our children ive got a plan to put 800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools,12
Bill Whitaker, thank you thank you senator,12
Elizabeth Warren, education is not free,12
Elizabeth Warren,  to our public schools education is not free we must invest in the future of our children,12
Bill Whitaker, senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, our campaign is about changing american priorities instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires were going to have high quality universal childcare for every family in this country because the psychologists tell us zero to four are the most important years of human development we are going to triple funding for lowincome title one schools because kids education should not depend upon the zip code in which they live were going to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree through a tax on wall street speculation and were going to move to make certain that no teacher in america earns less than 60000 a year we want great teachers,12
Bill Whitaker, mayor buttigieg,12
Pete Buttigieg, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators im a little biased because im married to one and i get an education about education every day i come home i have seen how teachers are being expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we dont have an adequate mental health system to support kids and now some politicians because they arent willing to face the need for common sense gun law are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when theres a threat to a classroom we have to show not only with compensation but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids and yes that means a secretary of education who will support teachers it also means investing im proposing an education access corps that would show that we are going to honor our teachers a little better,12
Elizabeth Warren, one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt,12
Bill Whitaker, pass this on to major,12
Major Garrett, candidates good evening good evening,12
Elizabeth Warren, people across this country are being crushed by student loan debt this is an issue we need to talk about,12
Pete Buttigieg, thats what my plan would do through the education access corps,12
Major Garrett, as we all know the political conversation in our country is interactive and because of our partner twitter this debate is no different so i want to put a question from twitter to you senator klobuchar this is from casey pennington how will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers,12
Amy Klobuchar, thank you this is one of the first times weve talked about housing and i put forward an extensive policy i think when ive looked at this both in my job in local government and in the senate one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live so the way you do that is first of all taking care of this section 8 backlog of applicants there are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting and i have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing secondly you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and third to help people pay for it,12
Amy Klobuchar, and i want to make clear given south carolina and the rural population as well as urban that this isnt just an urban problem its a big urban problem but its also a rural problem where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there but theyre not able to get housing so for me its building a coalition and i actually like to get these things done and the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done,12
Elizabeth Warren, this is a point where we need to talk about race though it is not enough to talk about housing neutrally and just be race blind it is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against african americans having an opportunity to buy homes thats redlining while mayor bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on african americans and on latinos in fact i was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages i have a housing plan and what it has in it specifically is a piece to deal with the effects of redlining we can no longer pretend that everything is race neutral we have got to address race consciously whats happening in this,12
Major Garrett, mayor bloomberg please we were going to ask you about this i want to give you a chance to respond because in addition to what senator warren just said on twitter she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about redlining,12
Mike Bloomberg, yes im sorry but unfortunately shes misinformed on redlining you can go back and look at the record i fought against it before 08 the crisis during 08 and after that redlining is not the problem with the mortgage market but it was a problem for the communities where it was done and we stopped that let me also say since i have the floor for a second that i really am surprised that all of these my fellow contestants up here i guess would be the right word for it given nobody pays attention to the clock im surprised they show up because i would have thought after i did such a good job in beating them last week that theyd be a little bit afraid to do that,12
Mike Bloomberg, but let me just say when youre talking about affordable housing we created 175000 units of affordable housing in new york city and i listened to them theyre in congress and they say that cant get it done cant get it done but if you change something like the president they would no you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done i did it in new york city i got the republican state senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country you can work across the aisle you just have to know how to deal with people,12
Major Garrett, mayor bloomberg thank you very much back to you bill,12
Bill Whitaker, vice president biden black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men are about twice as likely to be unemployed five times more likely to be incarcerated conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both democratic and republican administrations how do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities,12
Joe Biden, two ways number one my entire life ive been involved with the black community i was a public defender i worked in the projects i came along and first thing i did as the chairman of the judiciary committee extended the voting rights act eventually for 25 years and ive been deeply involved in my first effort i had as a councilman was doing away with redlining in the county the way we do this we got to help them create wealth and thats why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs are as successful as any other group of people in the country we go from 15 billion to 3 billion taking 30 billion off the sidelines thats how you create wealth secondly i provide for the opportunity for first time home buyers to be able to have a 15000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it,12
Joe Biden, thirdly i go after those people who are involved in gentrification because whats happening is were moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense theyre being bought out if anything you can not find a place to live and thirdly i make sure that with regard to housing we allow people look right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has your house is valued significantly less than the white the same exact house weve got to deal with the institutional racism,12
Bill Whitaker, thank you mr vice president,12
Joe Biden, i note how you cut me off all the time but im not going to be quiet anymore okay,12
Bill Whitaker, mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, every single policy area in the united states has a gigantic subtext of race were talking about education were talking about criminal justice were talking about housing were talking about loans i started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry basically to make loans to blackowned latinoowned and womenowned businesses weve supported over 8000 affordable housing units but more than that i believe im the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery something happened we should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400 plus years in america of african americans of systematic legal injustice discrimination and cruelty but also of 400 plus years of contribution in terms of building the united states of america and leading the united states of america from a moral standpoint,12
Bill Whitaker, thank you mr steyer ,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you bill senator klobuchar next question new topic new topic senator klobuchar if you could honor the rules of the debate thank you,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator klobuchar id like to change topics and ask you rural areas have populations who are older sicker and poorer than nonrural communities and they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to so how would you ensure that there is available healthcare in rural areas,12
Amy Klobuchar, people arent always aware i know you are in south carolina about how much poverty there is particularly child poverty in rural areas so the answer is one size doesnt fit all and one of the ways you do this right now we have something called critical access hospitals so theyre designated for rural areas and actually i am the lead democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered the other issue is we dont have enough personnel and so thats where we get to this education plan and i dont agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college,12
Amy Klobuchar, what i think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy were going to have a million openings for home healthcare workers particularly in rural areas that we dont know how to fill were going to have over 100000 openings for nursing assistants were not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees were going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses so putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback making one and two year degrees free and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go especially medical students into rural areas final thing is comprehensive immigration reform i have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas we need to expand that,12
Norah O’Donnell, mayor buttigieg the floor is yours same question,12
Pete Buttigieg, yeah when i was born there was no difference in your life expectancy if you were born in a rural area or a city now the gap is the biggest its been in a generation and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like south carolina were seeing hospital closures right and left and were seeing them in particular in states where medicaid was not expanded something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voter suppression see all of these things are connected housing wages the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform all of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles to the closing of voting locations and that harms everybody its why in my frederick douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues part of the core of it is a 21st century voting rights act,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, very proud working with,12
Bernie Sanders, very proud very proud working with congressman jim clyburn south carolina that we increased funding for the community health center program by 11 billion as part of the affordable care act which now provides for 9 million americans access to primary health care dental care mental health counseling and low cost prescription drugs in that bill we also put 2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors nurses dentists we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas the advantage of a medicare for all healthcare program because its not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies we will have healthcare for all people in all parts of this country,12
Pete Buttigieg, but in order for any of that to happen at us to pass,12
Speaker 1, thank you next topic gayle,12
Pete Buttigieg, and were talking about a plan that goes beyond what even what they do,12
Gayle King, mayor buttigieg im sorry going to go to mayor bloomberg were going to change topics mayor bloomberg as mayor of new york you declared war on obesity you banned trans fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same with large sugary drinks so if you become president will you push those policies on the national level as well,12
Mike Bloomberg, well i think whats right for new york city isnt necessarily right but all the other cities otherwise youd have a naked cowboy in every city so lets get serious here but i do think its the governments job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives we are a country where there are too many people that are obese we should do something about that but just take a look at what happened with smoking we did ban smoking in new york city in public places restaurants offices and that sort of thing and it has spread across america across europe across latin america even into places in the middle east and into the far east it has saved an enormous number of lives,12
Mike Bloomberg, so it just goes to show if you have good public health then you can do things and one of the great problems today you read about the virus whats really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialists in this country two years ago so theres nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing and hes defunded centers for disease control cdc so we dont have the organization we need this is a very serious thing as you see the stock markets falling apart because people are really worried and they should be we dont have anybody to respond im sorry,12
Gayle King, were going to talk about that in our next segment before i leave you are new yorkers living longer because of your policies,12
Mike Bloomberg, theres no question about that before i left life expectancy in new york city had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that when i left it was three years greater than the national average,12
Bernie Sanders, all right vice president biden please vice president biden,12
Joe Biden, look one of the things we have to do we have a thing in the defense department called darpa special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal with to make us safer they came up with the internet they came over the whole idea of stealth technology im going to do the same thing at the national institute of health were going to focus at least 50 billion over the first five years on focusing on obesity diabetes alzheimers and cancer and were going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment we can in fact find cures if we make the investment and we can get that done the american people support it even republicans will support it we have to focus on extending life saving life and making people put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely,12
Speaker 1, all right senator biden thank you senator klobuchar senator sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession as a former prosecutor is that a realistic promise,12
Amy Klobuchar, well it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana i want to do that too and i also think you need to look back at peoples records and you maybe cant do it on day one as he said i think you want to have a process that you go through because theres too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs i think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment and its not necessarily because of marijuana it is because of things like opioids and the like and thats why one of the first plans i put out was for treatment,12
Amy Klobuchar, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work you dont want to have repeat customers and you want to help people to get off of drugs and the way you do that is with drug courts the way you do that by the way is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you dont have a president that pellmell gives pardons to his buddies and to white collar offenders but that instead you have a set process that you use thats fair and is outside of the justice department and while getting their advice,12
Speaker 1, all right thank you senator klobuchar,12
Bernie Sanders, can i respond to that,12
Gayle King, mayor bloomberg id like to get your thoughts on this because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that weve never done research on,12
Mike Bloomberg, look the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount for dealers yes but for the average person no and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before number two were not going to take it away from states that have already done it but number three you should listen to the scientists and the doctors they say go very slowly they havent done enough research and the evidence so far is worrisome before we get all our kids particularly kids in their late teens boys even more than girls where this may be damaging their brains until we know the science its just nonsensical to push ahead but the cats out of the bag so some states have it youre not going to take it away get rid of the decriminalize the possession,12
Gayle King, all right thank you mr mayor,12
Speaker 1, senator sanders you were name checked,12
Bernie Sanders, all right look youre right we have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken it is racist got more people in jail than any other country on earth including china and one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs so i do believe that on day one we will change the federal controlled substance act which if you can believe it now equates heroin with marijuana thats insane were going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalized marijuana in every state in the country what we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people arrested for possession of marijuana and ill tell you what else were going to do were going to provide help to the african american latino native american community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market,12
Gayle King, all right senator sanders thank you,12
Joe Biden, i wrote the drug court bill can i,12
Gayle King, weve passed the halfway mark,12
Joe Biden, can i respond to this i wrote the bill that setup drug courts,12
Gayle King, all right thank you vice president biden we will get back to you the cbs news democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break,12
Norah O’Donnell, welcome back to the cbs news democratic debate each of you is campaigning for the role as commander in chief where you will command 13 million us troops and be responsible for protecting americas national security there are also 53000 here in south carolina senator warren you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the middle east and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops,12
Elizabeth Warren, i do,12
Norah O’Donnell, how does that protect americas national security,12
Elizabeth Warren, look a presidents first job is to keep america safe and an important part of that is to have a strong military all three of my brothers served in the military and i understand how much the military sacrifices how much their families sacrifice and how much they are willing to put on the line that means that we have a sacred responsibility to them and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily,12
Elizabeth Warren, we are not winning in afghanistan we are not winning in the middle east what we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox we need a strong military we also need a strong state department those are our eyes and ears on the ground they are our front lines in diplomacy we need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy and we need strong alliances we need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators we need not to cut and run on our allies we need an approach that keeps us safe by using,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator thank you,12
Elizabeth Warren, all of the tools in a measured way,12
Norah O’Donnell, mayor bloomberg voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views would you pull all combat troops out of the middle east,12
Mike Bloomberg, no you want to cut it back as much as you can but i think if we learned something from 911 people plan things overseas and execute them here we have to be able to stop terrorism and theres no guarantees that youre going to be able to do it but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate and to not do so is just irresponsible we shouldnt be fighting wars that we cant win we should go to war only as a last resort nobody argues with that but this is a dangerous world and if we havent learned that after 911 i dont know whats going to teach us what to do we have to do something and i think the budget that we things that ive seen recently convinced me that the military today is betterprepared than theyve been in an awful long time and that the moneys they are spending on the war are for,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Mike Bloomberg, weapons we need for the next war and,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you ,12
Mike Bloomberg, not for the last a common mistake that theyre not making now,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you  gayle,12
Mike Bloomberg, theyre doing a good job,12
Gayle King, mayor buttigieg id like to go to you as the only veteran on stage can you weigh in on this,12
Pete Buttigieg, well the first time i ever set foot in south carolina it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near fort jackson that was to get ready to go to afghanistan where i saw that one of the things that kept me safe just as sure as my body armor was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word our allies and our adversaries knew it the president has torn that to shreds and so the first thing weve got to do is restore the credibility of the united states,12
Pete Buttigieg, second thing we got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities and i guess i disagree with the mayor i dont think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world but we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground but what good is that if you have a president who wont listen to them right now some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counterterrorism but issues like global health security and the coronavirus that rely on the ability to listen to scientists,12
Gayle King, time mr mayor,12
Pete Buttigieg, listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated,12
Gayle King, time mr mayor,12
Pete Buttigieg, because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall,12
Gayle King, i know it goes fast but a minute 15 is really a long time so wed ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time,12
Joe Biden, good idea,12
Gayle King, senator klobuchar good idea right mr vice president senator klobuchar as we were coming over here today i promise mr vice president we are going to get to you today i promise,12
Joe Biden, you keep promising me that but you havent done it yet,12
Gayle King, ive never broken a promise,12
Joe Biden, well lets get to it,12
Gayle King, senator klobuchar,12
Amy Klobuchar, why dont we let me answer then you,12
Gayle King, as we were coming over today there was breaking news from the cdc about the coronavirus so far there have been 2700 deaths globally and so far in this country there have been no deaths but the cdc says this its not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when the question to you is this would you close the borders to americans who have been exposed to the coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country,12
Amy Klobuchar, well what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those americans and that they are in a quarantine situation we dont want to expose people but we want to give them help and i would agree when mayor bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget he tried to cut back on the cdc he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world he hasnt yet really addressed the nation on this topic i would do all of that,12
Amy Klobuchar, but i want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the american people because this is so serious im not going to give my website right now im going to give the cdcs website which is cdcgov so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their healthcare provider because many doctors are saying its just a matter of time before were going to start seeing this here,12
Amy Klobuchar, and i think the answers as president what would i do i would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you senator klobuchar,12
Amy Klobuchar, i would have better relations with our allies and i would support because i know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school in columbia south carolina or houston texas and its investing in education so we are ready to lead again in the world,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator thank you mr vice president we reached a turning point today with the cdc warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close members of the trump administration saying we dont have enough medical masks if necessary what would you do,12
Joe Biden, what we did with ebola i was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the united states saved millions of lives and what we did we set up i helped set up that office in the presidents office on diseases that are pandemic diseases we increased the budget of the cdc we increased the nih budget we shouldve our president today and hes wiped all that out we did it we stopped it,12
Joe Biden, and the second thing id point out to you is that what i would do immediately is restore the funding he cut the funding for cdc he tried to cut the funding for nih he cut the funding for the entire effort and heres the deal i would be on the phone with china and making it clear we are going to need to be in your country you have to be open you have to be clear we have to know whats going on we have to be there with you and insist on it,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Joe Biden, and insist insist insist i could get that done no one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders im the only one that has,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, in the white house today we have a selfdescribed great genius selfdescribed and this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months april is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the white house has determined i wish i was kidding that is what he said what do we have to do whether or not the issue is climate change which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation or infectious diseases like coronavirus requiring international cooperation we have to work and expand the world health organization obviously we have to make sure the cdc the nih our infectious departments are fully funded this is a global problem,12
Norah O’Donnell, thank you,12
Bernie Sanders, weve got to work with countries,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator,12
Bernie Sanders, all over the world to solve it,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator were going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs margaret brennan,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you norah mayor bloomberg youve said that president xi jinping of china is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents and that the us must cooperate with beijing how far does that go would you allow chinese firms to build critical us infrastructure,12
Mike Bloomberg, no i would not and i think the chinese government has not been open their press the freedom of press does not exist there their human rights record is abominable and we should make a fuss which weve been doing i suppose but make no mistake about it we have to deal with china if were ever going to solve the climate crisis we have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked we would not be able to sell or buy the products that we need,12
Mike Bloomberg, and in terms of whether hes a dictator he does serve at the behest of the politburo their group of people but theres no question he has an enormous amount of power but he does play to his constituency you can negotiate with him thats exactly what we have to do make it seem that its in his interest and its in his peoples interest to do what we want to do follow the rules particularly no stealing of intellectual property follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you mr mayor vice president biden,12
Pete Buttigieg, im worried about xi jinping in the context of the virus too,12
Margaret Brennan, vice president biden same question to you would you allow chinese firms to build critical us infrastructure,12
Joe Biden, no i would not and id spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office this is a guy who doesnt have a democratic with a small d bone in his body this is a guy who is a thug who in fact has a million uyghurs in reconstruction camps meaning concentration camps this is a guy who you see whats happening right now in hong kong and this is a guy who i was able to convince should join the paris agreement because guess what they need to be involved you can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are,12
Joe Biden, when in fact they said were going to set up a nofly zone that you cant fly through our zone he said what do you expect me to do when i was over there i said were going to fly right through it we flew b1 bombers through it we got to make it clear they must play by the rules,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you mr vice president,12
Joe Biden, period period period,12
Margaret Brennan, senator warren same question would you allow chinese firms to build infrastructure,12
Elizabeth Warren, we have to be able to trust our president because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just cant follow every part of that and thats one the reasons that we need to see any candidates taxes we know that mayor bloomberg has been doing business with china for a long time and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes he plans to release them after super tuesday it is not enough to be able to say just trust me on this we have a president who said he was going to,12
Margaret Brennan, the questions about infrastructure,12
Elizabeth Warren, release his taxes after the election,12
Margaret Brennan, was that a yes or a no,12
Elizabeth Warren, and has refused to do this no i would not,12
Margaret Brennan, okay mayor bloomberg would you like to respond,12
Mike Bloomberg, i got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago weve been working on our tax returns ive said therell be out we probably have another couple of weeks left to go were doing it as fast as we can weve complied with every single requirement for disclosure and when i was mayor of new york we had our tax returns out 12 years in a row and we will do that in the white house,12
Elizabeth Warren, no actually,12
Margaret Brennan,  mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, listen,12
Pete Buttigieg, you know you can find tax returns online right now,12
Margaret Brennan, on infrastructure,12
Elizabeth Warren, actually he put the tax returns,12
Margaret Brennan, on the question asked,12
Tom Steyer, can i look,12
Margaret Brennan, mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, ive released my tax returns,12
Elizabeth Warren, yeah,12
Tom Steyer, that was easy to do but i want to say something about foreign policy,12
Mike Bloomberg, how many years,12
Tom Steyer, 10 years i want to say something about foreign policy which is this we keep acting as if were in the 20th century or the 19th century if you look at the biggest threats to the united states were talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the united states were talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need us leadership for countries around the world in fact mr trumps policy of us going it alone of america first of having no values no allies and no strategy is disastrous for us the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate and its time for us to deal with it that way,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership,12
Margaret Brennan, the next,12
Tom Steyer, and coalition,12
Margaret Brennan, new topic senator sanders youve praised,12
Bernie Sanders, can i say one word,12
Margaret Brennan, its in the same theme sir youve praised the chinese communist party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country you also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in cuba and in nicaragua can americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass,12
Bernie Sanders, i have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and i was really amazed at what mayor bloomberg just said a moment ago he said that the chinese government is responsive to the politburo but who the hell is the politburo responsive to who elects the politburo you got a real dictatorship there of course you have a dictatorship in cuba what i said is what barack obama said in terms of cuba that cuba made progress on education yes i think,12
Speaker 1, boo,12
Bernie Sanders, really really,12
Pete Buttigieg, yes because theres no comparing those two commentaries,12
Bernie Sanders, literacy programs are bad what barack obama said is,12
Pete Buttigieg, what barack obama was doing was opening diplomatic doors what you were doing is making excuses,12
Bernie Sanders, they made great progress on education and healthcare that was barack obama occasionally,12
Joe Biden, ive talked to barack obama,12
Bernie Sanders, excuse me occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy and that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world in chile in guatemala in iran and when dictatorships whether it is the chinese or the cubans do something good,12
Margaret Brennan, time,12
Bernie Sanders, you acknowledge that,12
Margaret Brennan, time mr vice president,12
Bernie Sanders, but you dont have to trade love letters with them,12
Margaret Brennan, vice president biden would you like,12
Pete Buttigieg, this is 2020 we cant be reliving the cold war,12
Margaret Brennan, mr vice president,12
Joe Biden,  look barack obama was abroad he was in a town meeting he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the cuban government he acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy but he went on and condemned the dictatorship he went on and condemned the people who in fact had run that committee he also made sure to make it clear and by the way i called to make sure that i was prepared to i never say my private conversations with him but the fact of the matter is he in fact does not did not has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now,12
Margaret Brennan, okay,12
Joe Biden, this man said that in fact that he did not condemn,12
Joe Biden,  man said that in fact he thought it was he did not condemn what they did,12
Bernie Sanders, that is untrue categorically untrue,12
Joe Biden, what did you tell him,12
Bernie Sanders, i have condemned authoritarianism whether it is the people in saudi arabia that the united states government has loved for years,12
Joe Biden, how about cuba and nicaragua,12
Bernie Sanders, cuba nicaragua authoritarianism of any stripe is bad,12
Joe Biden, period,12
Bernie Sanders, that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good,12
Joe Biden, oh come on,12
Bernie Sanders, look at what barack obama said about international ,12
Margaret Brennan, could i as the person buttigieg,12
Pete Buttigieg, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency and i am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to donald trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and bernie sanders with the nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s this is not about what cous were happening in the 1970s or 80s this is about the future this is about 2020 we are not going to survive or succeed and theyre certainly not going to win by reliving the cold war and were not going to win these critical critical house and senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the castro regime weve got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future,12
Margaret Brennan, senator sanders your response,12
Bernie Sanders, let us be clear do we think healthcare for all pete is some kind of radical communist idea,12
Pete Buttigieg, glad you brought this up lets talk about that,12
Bernie Sanders, do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage,12
Pete Buttigieg, im happy to respond to the question because this is really important,12
Bernie Sanders, do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing,12
Pete Buttigieg, no if youre going to ask that rhetorical question lets go behind the,12
Bernie Sanders, do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea,12
Pete Buttigieg, lets talk about whats radical about that plan senator please,12
Bernie Sanders, do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea,12
Pete Buttigieg, senator the things you just named are the things we favor but the way youre talking about doing it is radical by,12
Bernie Sanders, the truth is,12
Margaret Brennan, one at a time,12
Bernie Sanders, pete the american people support my agenda that is why i am beating trump in virtually every poll and is why i will defeat him,12
Pete Buttigieg, weve got to open this up universal healthcare for example,12
Margaret Brennan, senator klobuchar,12
Amy Klobuchar, donald trumps bernie donald trumps worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for and i was going to comment on cuba policy because i actually lead the bill to lift the embargo i went with barack obama when he went to cuba and ive seen firsthand how the cuban people are way in front of their leaders they like america they want to be entrepreneurs and the way that we embrace them and not the socialist regime is by opening up cuba and starting to do business with them but to get at what we were just talking about i just think we have a huge choice super tuesday states one third of america will vote do you want to have someone in charge of this ticket,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you senator,12
Amy Klobuchar, could i finish margaret,12
Margaret Brennan, well youre at time senator,12
Amy Klobuchar, we want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward 60 trillion in spending three times the american economy i dont think we do i think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that were going to turn off the voters that we need to bring in,12
Margaret Brennan, you have to allow this senator to respond senator peter,12
Pete Buttigieg, ive got to respond to the question that senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, amy used the word alienating hey amy my favorability nationally i believe are the highest up here as a matter of fact but the point is the way we are going to beat trump which is what everybody up here wants is we need a campaign of energy and excitement we need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the united states we need to bring working people back into the democratic party we need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before that is what our campaign is about,12
Margaret Brennan, bill whitaker has the floor,12
Bill Whitaker, vice president biden,12
Joe Biden, yes,12
Bill Whitaker, the bipartisan senate select committee on intelligence report concluded russia interfered in our last presidential election and the obama administration failed to respond forcefully us intelligence says russias at it again if it is proven that russia has interfered in the 2020 elections would you as president launch a retaliatory cyber attack,12
Joe Biden, i would make them pay for it and id make them pay for it economic they are engaged now as i speak in interfering in our election they were engaged when in fact we were the last election in 2016 against hillary they were theres no question this man stood before the whole world turned to the russian leader and said why in gods name would this man ever interfere in our elections give me a break 17 intelligence agencies said he did when we got the information we went to the committee in the senate thats responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them we went to mitch mcconnell and said join us and point out what is happening here he said no we want no part of it and if we had moved we didnt have all the information at that time until after the election was over and so the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more theoretically thats true but the fact of the matter is we didnt have the information until the end and so look we in fact should be imposing sanctions on russia now for their interference,12
Bill Whitaker, mr steyer,12
Tom Steyer, look 21st century warfare is cyber warfare what were having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now the question you have to ask is wheres the commander inchief and let me say this,12
Joe Biden, we dont have one,12
Tom Steyer, this isnt news what vice president biden said is true he did stand next to vladimir putin there was a hostile foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power thats why i started need to impeach thats what we have to do we have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the united states of america thats where we are where are all these patriotic republicans who wave the flag but when were actually under attack they side with our enemies its outrageous thats why he should have been impeached they covered it up and i was years before these people theres something wrong here were under attack and theyre not doing a darn thing about it,12
Bill Whitaker, thank you mr steyer major,12
Major Garrett, senator sanders senator sanders i have a question for you sir youre the front runner in this race youre on the ballot in south carolina mayor bloomberg youll understand that preamble in just a second if elected senator sanders you would be americas first jewish president you recently called a very prominent wellknown american israel lobby a platform for quote bigotry what would you say to american jews who might be concerned youre not from their perspective supportive enough of israel and specifically sir would you move the us embassy back to tel aviv,12
Bernie Sanders, let me just the answer is its something that we would take into consideration but here is the point i am very proud of being jewish i actually lived in israel for some months but what i happen to believe is that right now sadly tragically in israel through bibi netanyahu you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country and i happen to believe i happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the mideast should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of israel but you cannot ignore the suffering of the palestinian people we have got to have a policy that reaches out to the palestinians and the americans and in answer to your question that will come within the context of bringing nations together in the mideast,12
Major Garrett, mayor bloomberg would you like to weigh in on that please,12
Mike Bloomberg, well the battles been going on for a long time in the middle east whether its the arabs versus the persians the shias versus the sunnis the jews in israel and the palestinians its only gone on for 40 or 50 years number one you cant move the embassy back we should not have done it without getting something from the israeli government but it was done and youre going to have to leave it there number two only solution here is a two state solution the palestinians have to be accommodated the real problem here is you have two groups of people both of who think god them the same piece of land and the answer is to obviously split it up leave the israeli borders where they are try to push them to pull back some of those extra over on the other side of the wall where theyve built these new communities which they should not have done that pull it back,12
Major Garrett, mayor bloomberg thank you very much senator warren,12
Elizabeth Warren, look the way we have to think about this is i think we have to start with the values and what has to be protected here israelis have a right to security and the palestinians have a right to be treated with dignity and to have self determination that is a two state solution but its not up to us to determine what the terms of a two state solution are we want to be a good ally to everyone in the region the best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves donald trumps big mistake is he keeps putting a thumb on the scale on just one side and that moves the parties further away from working out their own solution here we need to be an ally by supporting them to come to negotiate to find a lasting peace,12
Major Garrett, but senator warren just on the question of the embassy what was your position on that,12
Elizabeth Warren, it is not ours to do,12
Major Garrett, would you move it back,12
Elizabeth Warren, it is not ours to do we should let the parties determine the capitals themselves,12
Major Garrett, norah,12
Norah O’Donnell, i want to turn now to the issue of north korea because president trump has engaged in a direct diplomacy meeting directly with kim jongun senator klobuchar if you were commanderinchief would you meet with the north korean leader,12
Amy Klobuchar, i would but not in the way this president has done it he literally thinks he can go over and bring a hot dish to the dictator next door and he thinks everythings going to be fine he has not done it with our allies he has literally just hastily called summit and run off that is no way to do it and as you can see north korea is emboldened theyre still launching missiles they promised a christmas surprise that thankfully never happened and he has not been able to advance the ball at all so what would i do i would work with our allies and it has been pointed out this is what this president fails at all the time,12
Amy Klobuchar, we should be negotiating ourselves back into the iran nuclear agreement we should be working with russia not only to stand up for the protection of our elections and call vladimir putin out for what he is the ruthless dictator that takes down planes that poisons dissidence but that also at the same time we have to acknowledge that we should be renegotiating the new start treaty and the other arms negotiations that must happen this president just likes to do tweets at 400 am in his bathrobe gets out there and doesnt achieve the results we need i would meet with him but i would do it with our allies i would have clear deliverables and i would achieve those deliverables,12
Norah O’Donnell, senator klobuchar thank you mr vice president how would you deal with north korea,12
Joe Biden, you dont negotiate with a dictator give him legitimacy without any notion whether he is going to do anything at all you dont do that look what happened he gave this dictator hes a thug legitimacy weve weakened the sanctions around the world against holding us committing people not to trade benefiting from oil to parts that they can deal with providing missile technology and whats happened its been weakened i would be in beijing i would be calling to i would be speaking with xi jinping i would be reassigning the relationship between japan and south korea and i would make it clear i would make it clear to china we are going to continue to move closer to make sure that we can in fact prevent china prevent north korea from launching missiles to take them down and if we dont why am i stopping no one else stops,12
Norah O’Donnell, okay,12
Joe Biden, its my catholic school training,12
Norah O’Donnell, okay,12
Gayle King, vice president biden youre a gentleman good home training thank you sir,12
Joe Biden, gentlemen dont get very well treated up here,12
Norah O’Donnell, margaret brennan,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you very much norah this is a question for mayor buttigieg as you know viewers and voters are participating in this through twitter the city of idlib in syria is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis the syrian regime and russia are targeting schools bakeries and hospitals what would you do as president to push back regime and russian forces and stop the killing of innocent civilians,12
Pete Buttigieg, first of all i stand with the people of idlib who are being targeted as you said in a brutal fashion by a dictatorship that has already been so brutal for so many years and this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region because the president has basically vanished from the stage when it comes to even playing a role in the future there turkey russia iran all have so much more of a say than we do we dont have to be invading countries to be making a difference working with our international partners in order to deliver peace and support those who are standing up for selfdetermination now i want to come back to something and i promise it relates to international affairs because senator sanders asked me a question earlier he asked the question of whether healthcare for everybody is a radical idea and its not which is why im for it very much in a different way though what is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance and part of how you know it is is that no industrialized country has gone that far,12
Pete Buttigieg, he and i both like to talk about denmark for example but even in denmark they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance so this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in denmark the country let alone imagining how thats going to fly in denmark south carolina,12
Margaret Brennan, thank you mayor,12
Bernie Sanders, can i respond,12
Margaret Brennan, senator warren,12
Bernie Sanders, can i respond to that,12
Margaret Brennan, senator warren would you like to respond what would senator warren do to stop the mass murder,12
Elizabeth Warren, im sorry,12
Margaret Brennan, same question what would you do to stop the mass murder in idlib syria,12
Elizabeth Warren, look i think that what weve got to do is we have to provide humanitarian relief we need to work with our allies on this but this is not a moment for military intervention we have got to use our military only when we see a military problem that can be solved militarily we cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out so for me this is about working with our allies it is about standing with the people who are under enormous pressure right now this is recognizing what donald trump has put us in in a terrible box around the world but the solution is not to use our military the solution is to use the other tools here,12
Gayle King, thank you senator weve talked a lot about your policies during this debate now wed like to get a little more personal i know senator sanders how much you enjoy that were going to ask you when we come back from the break about the words you live by were going to give you a couple of minutes to gather your thoughts well be right back,12
Margaret Brennan, welcome back to charleston south carolina this is the final segment of the final debate before the first in the south primary this saturday and super tuesday one week from today gail,12
Gayle King, all right one final question candidates and its a two parter first id like you each to tell us the biggest misconception about you thats number one number two the south carolina motto is this while i breathe i hope so outside of politics and no more than 45 seconds or so what is your personal motto your personal belief your favorite quote that represents you mr steyer the biggest misconception and then your motto,12
Tom Steyer, the biggest misconception about me is that its somehow im defined by business success and money,12
Gayle King, okay and your motto,12
Tom Steyer, my motto every day i write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth and do whats right no matter what,12
Gayle King, all right thank you mr steyer senator klobuchar,12
Amy Klobuchar, id say the biggest  the biggest misconception is that im boring because im not i would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors paul wellstone whos sadly no longer with us and he said that politics is about improving peoples lives and thats been my life from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner and the unions politics made them those mines safer and when my dad needed treatment it was there for him and in his words he was pursued by grace and when my mom got divorced and she didnt have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through and then when our daughter was born,12
Gayle King, senator klobuchar im sorry what was your motto im sorry what was your motto,12
Amy Klobuchar, oh i thought we had a minute to answer the question,12
Gayle King, what was your motto im sorry,12
Amy Klobuchar, my motto was that politics is about improving peoples lives,12
Gayle King, got it got it vice president biden biggest misconception,12
Amy Klobuchar, pretty good one,12
Gayle King, it was very good one very good one thank you,12
Joe Biden, when you get knocked down get up and everyones entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what no matter who they are mine also that everyone should be represented that no ones better than me and im no better than anyone else the fact is what we should be doing we talked about the supreme court im looking forward to making sure theres a black woman on the supreme court to make sure  not a joke not a joke i pushed very hard for that,12
Gayle King, vice president,12
Joe Biden, my mothers motto was she said youre defined by your courage or redeemed by your loyalty i am loyal i do what i say,12
Gayle King, whats the biggest misconception about you sir,12
Joe Biden, i have more hair than i think i do,12
Gayle King, theres a way to fix that senator sanders,12
Bernie Sanders, misconception,12
Gayle King, yes,12
Bernie Sanders, misconception and youre hearing it here tonight is that the ideas im talking about are radical theyre not in one form or another they exist in countries all over the world healthcare is a human right we have the necessity the moral imperative to address the existential threat of climate change other countries are doing that we dont need more people in jail disproportionately african american than any other country on earth not a radical idea the motto the saying that that moves me the most is from nelson mandela and mandela said everything is impossible until it happens and that means if we have the guts to stand up to powerful special interest were doing phenomenally well if we can bring working people together black and white and latino we can create a nation,12
Gayle King, all right senator thank you,12
Bernie Sanders, where all people have a good standard of living,12
Gayle King, senator warren,12
Elizabeth Warren, well i suppose one misconception is that i dont eat very much in fact i eat all the time because i get teased about this look i never was supposed to be on a stage like this and the misconception is that i thought i should be president of the united states no i got into this because i am a fighter my motto ties in directly to this its matthew 25 and that is in as much as she hath done it into one of these the least of thy brethren ye have done it unto me for me this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up that is why i am in this fight that is why i am running to be president and it is why i will be an effective president,12
Gayle King, thank you senator now buttigieg,12
Pete Buttigieg, i think the biggest conception misconception is that im not passionate i get that im kind of level some say unflappable i dont think you want a president whos flappable but its precisely because im so passionate about the things that are going on in this country that i consider it important to approach all of that with discipline and my disciplines are guided by the motto is i try to live by many of which come from scripture and just to be clear i would never impose my interpretation of my religion on anybody,12
Pete Buttigieg, just to sure as im wearing this ring ill never let that happen to anybody but i seek to live by the teachings that say that if you would be a leader you must first be a servant and of course the teaching not unique to the christian tradition but a big part of it that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated and when i think about everything at stake from racial and economic justice to our stewardship of the climate to the need to heal the sick and the need to heal this country i seek for those teachings to order my steps as i go through this campaign and as i go through life,12
Elizabeth Warren, thank you mayor bloomberg,12
Mike Bloomberg, misconception that im six feet tall and quote ive trained for this job for a long time and when i get it im going to do something rather than just talk about it,12

Jake Tapper, welcome to this unique event the cnn univision democratic presidential debate with the two leading candidates for the democratic nomination former vice president joe biden and vermont senator bernie sanders candidates welcome its good to have you im jake tapper along with cnns dana bash and univisions ilia calderón,13
Dana Bash, we come together tonight at an extraordinary time in our country when people are worried about far more than just presidential politics were in a national emergency because of the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus it has killed nearly 6000  and more than 3300 known cases here in the united states as a result tonights debate will focus heavily on the crisis,13
Ilia Calderón, the setting of this debate is also different to reduce unnecessary risk of transmission of the virus cnn univision the democratic national committee and the campaigns moved this debate from phoenix arizona to here at cnn studios in washington without any audience,13
Jake Tapper, all of this comes of course as four more states florida arizona ohio and illinois prepare to vote on tuesday with vice president biden currently leading senator sanders in the race for delegates heres what were going to do tonight each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals as much as we can we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you so lets begin with the most important issue right now the coronavirus and what you would do as president in the face of it vice president biden let me start with you were in a reality right now that mightve seemed unimaginable a week ago schools have been canceled for more than 25 million students grocery store shelves have been cleared out march madness nba games disney parks broadway small businesses all shut down and just today the cdc issued a new recommendation that for the next eight weeks events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the us be canceled or postponed what do you say to the american people who are confronting this new reality,13
Joe Biden, first of all my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone or those who are suffering from the virus and this is bigger than any one of us this calls for a national rallying to everybody move together and i laid out in detail what i would do were i president today you can go to joebidencom i laid it out in significant detail but there are three pieces of this first of all have to take care of those who in fact are exposed or are likely to be exposed to the virus and that means we have to do testing we have to get the testing kits up and ready,13
Joe Biden, i would have the world health organization id take advantage of the test kits they have available to us even though the president says a million or more are coming lets just get all the tests we can done as quickly as we can secondly i would make sure that every state in the union had at least 10 places where they had drivethrough testing arrangements i would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds we have that capacity in the department of defense as well as with the fema and they can set up hundredbed 500bed hospitals and tents quickly,13
Joe Biden, we have to lay all that out but we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly and that means making sure that people who in fact lose their job dont get a paycheck cant pay their mortgage are able to pay it and pay them now and do it now small businesses be able to borrow interestfree loans i see my time is up here youre going to hold us tightly i assume but thats what i would do go to joebidencom it lays out precisely what i would do were i president today,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders this morning dr anthony fauci acknowledged that its possible that hundreds of thousands if not millions of americans could die of coronavirus in a worstcase scenario if you were president right now whats the most important thing you would do tonight to try to save american lives,13
Bernie Sanders, well first thing we have got to do whether or not im president is to shut this president up right now because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the american people it is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information which is confusing the general public second of all what we need to do and im glad that he has called a state of national emergency what we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus that all payments will be made that they dont have to worry about coming up with money for testing they dont have to worry about coming up with money for treatment,13
Bernie Sanders, this is an unprecedented moment in american history now i obviously believe in medicare for all i will fight for that as president but right now in this emergency i want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick you go to the doctor when you get sick if you have the virus that will be paid for do not worry about the cost right now because were in the middle of a national emergency,13
Bernie Sanders, second of all we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need have the ic units that they need right now we have a lack of medical personnel and i worry very much that if there is a peak whether we have the capability of dealing with the hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals so we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis bottom line from an economic point of view what we have got to say to the american people if you lose your job you will be made whole youre not going to lose income if trump can put or the fed can put a trillion and a half into the banking system ,13
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,13
Bernie Sanders,  we can protect the wages of every worker in america,13
Jake Tapper, thank you senator vice president biden president trump says he does not take any responsibility for the problems with coronavirus testing in part because he says he inherited so many rules regulations and red tape did bureaucratic red tape hamper this response in any way,13
Joe Biden, no look the world health organization offered offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now we refused them we did not want to buy them we did not want to get them from them we wanted to make sure we had our own i think he said something like we have the best scientists in america or something to that effect the idea that we are not prepared for this and not  the other thing i want to point out and i agree with bernie were in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed needed now,13
Joe Biden, the present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come so we should already be sitting down and planning where were going to put these temporary hospitals and we can do that we did that  weve been through this before with the coronavirus weve been through this  i mean excuse me weve been through this before with dealing with the viruses that the n1h1 as well as what happened in africa we provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics and were able to do it quickly and people would have a place to go but we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders and thats not being done either,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders on that note and both of you have addressed this but obviously another major health concern right now for officials is the potential surge in patients all at once overburdening hospitals the healthcare system youve mentioned icu beds both of you and ventilators were already in the middle of flu season so already a lot of those beds and ventilators are already being used if you were president right now what would you do to make sure every sick american is able to get treatment so the us does not suffer the same fate as italy where doctors have to decide right now who gets lifesaving treatment and who does not,13
Bernie Sanders, jake lets be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system now were spending twice as much per person on healthcare as the people of any other country how in gods name does it happen that we end up with 87 million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight and say im not feeling well should i go to the doctor but i cant afford to go to the doctor what happens if i am sick its going to cost thousands of dollars for treatment whos going to feed my kids we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,13
Bernie Sanders, were spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic how come we dont have enough doctors how come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down how come people cant afford to get the prescription drugs they need because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry ripping us off every single day and ill tell you something right now in the midst of this epidemic youve got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying oh wow what an opportunity to make a fortune so the word has got to go out i certainly would do this as president you dont worry people of america do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs do not worry about the cost of the healthcare that youre going to get because we are a nation a civilized democratic society everybody rich and poor middleclass will get the care they need the drug companies will not rip us off,13
Dana Bash, thank you senator vice president biden some medical experts are saying the only true way to control this virus is through a national quarantine requiring every american other than essential personnel to stay home would you take that unprecedented step of a national lockdown,13
Joe Biden, what i would do is what we did in our administration i would call a meeting in the situation room of all the experts in america dealing with this crisis i would sit them down and i would do exactly what we did then what is it that we need listen to the experts what do we need with all due respect to medicare for all you have a singlepayer system in italy it doesnt work there it has nothing to do with medicare for all that would not solve the problem at all we can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to pay for treatment period because of the crisis no one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed period because of the crisis no one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis period that is a national emergency and thats how its handled,13
Joe Biden, it is not working in italy right now and they have a singlepayer system now with regard to what else i would do the fact is that were in a position where i would bring together the leading experts in the world instead of doing this in the united states instead of doing this piecemeal sit down and do what we did before with the ebola crisis what is needed and have one voice one voice like we did every day we met on that crisis in the situation room so we lay out overall for all the nation what the best proposal is and how to move forward in the absence of that governors are making some sound decisions theyre doing the best they can by going out and getting the healthcare experts in their communities and their states to move but it should be directed from the white house from the situation room laying out in detail like we did in the ebola crisis ,13
Dana Bash, thank you,13
Joe Biden,  and we beat it,13
Dana Bash, thank you senator sanders your response,13
Bernie Sanders, well first of all the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system is obviously apparent as i said earlier there are people who hesitate go to the doctor youre going to have the maze of regulations well if this is my income but thats my income can i get it can i not get it clearly we are not prepared and trump only exacerbates the crisis when we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country one might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs one might expect that we were preparing effectively for a pandemic that we were ready with the ventilators with the icus with the test kits that we need,13
Bernie Sanders, we are not and bottom line here is in terms of medicare for all despite what the vice president is saying what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we dont have a system we got thousands of private insurance plans that is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people in a good year without the epidemic were losing up to 60000 people who die every year because they dont get to a doctor on time its clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse,13
Joe Biden, that has nothing to do when youre in a national crisis the national crisis says were responding its all free you dont have to pay for a thing that has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy this is a crisis were at war with the virus were at war with the virus it has nothing to do with copays or anything we just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this period,13
Bernie Sanders, thats not true as a matter of fact thats not true that law has enormous loopholes i understand that nancy pelosi did her best republicans prevented it what youre,13
Joe Biden, no im,13
Bernie Sanders, what youre talking about joe here is enormous loopholes within that that in fact it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in america and that people are going to be stuck with a bill unless we change that and were going to offer legislation to in fact change that,13
Joe Biden, if i may i offered legislation i laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the house i laid out in the plan that i laid out for how we would deal with this crisis nobody nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis this is a national emergency there isnt a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance or anything else we out of the treasury are going to pay for this its a national emergency,13
Bernie Sanders, but you see ,13
Joe Biden, thats what my plan calls for,13
Bernie Sanders, but the weakness of this is lets just do a hypothetical a family members diagnosed with the virus,13
Joe Biden, yep,13
Bernie Sanders, terrible tragedy massive anxiety the wife has the virus the husband is a wreck wants to go to a psychologist wants to get counseling doesnt have the money to do that maybe their kid breaks a leg they dont have the money to go to healthcare so youre saying right now in the middle of a crisis but you know what last year at least 30000 people died in america because they didnt get healthcare when they should because we dont have universal coverage i think thats a crisis one out of five people in america cannot afford the prescription drugs they need they suffer some die i consider that a crisis bottom line is we need a simple system which exists in canada exists in countries all over the world and that is if you are an american you get the healthcare you need end of discussion we can save huge sums of money doing that the trick is do we have the guts to take on the healthcare industry some of which is funding the vice presidents campaign do we have the courage to take on the executives at the prescription drug industry ,13
Dana Bash, thank you senator,13
Bernie Sanders,  some of whom are funding his campaign,13
Dana Bash, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, look this is a national crisis i dont want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here ive laid out a plan building on obamacare providing a public option of medicare that would cover everyone the same way this idea that this is his only answer is a mistaken notion but regardless of whether my plan was in place or his this is a crisis this is like we are being attacked from abroad this is something that is of great consequence this is like a war and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people and what you do is you and i have proposed it and laid it out in detail everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free it is paid for by the taxpayers generally generally it has nothing to do with bernies medicare for all by the way the ,13
Dana Bash, vice president biden thank you,13
Bernie Sanders, let me just,13
Dana Bash, if i may the vice president had just mentioned war would you deploy the us military in effort to contain the virus and if so how,13
Bernie Sanders, well i think we use all of the tools that make sense if using the national guard which is folks i think in new york state are already using the national guard that is something that has to be done this is clearly as the vice president indicated a national emergency what i worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession,13
Bernie Sanders, right now in illinois and ohio if my memory is correct the governor there has said theyre closing down bars theyre closing down restaurants what happens to the workers who are there what happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs what i think we have got to do right now is if trump can provide or the fed can provide a trillion and a half for liquidity for the banks what weve got to say to every worker in america you know what dont panic youre not going to  youll be able to pay your mortgage because youre going to get a check,13
Dana Bash, senator,13
Bernie Sanders, youre going to be made whole,13
Dana Bash, senator were going to talk about the economic  oh go ahead mr vice president,13
Joe Biden, the answer is i would call out the military,13
Dana Bash, okay,13
Joe Biden, now they have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation i would make sure that they did exactly what theyre prepared to do theyve done it they did it in the ebola crisis theyve done it they have the capacity to build 500bed hospitals and tents that are completely safe and secure and provide the help to get it done to anybody this overflow so it is a national emergency i would call out the military,13
Bernie Sanders, well the ebola crisis is one thing this is obviously a pandemic which is far more severe and impactful to this country i think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told stay home dont leave your house whos going to get food to them how do we get food to them youve got schools all over this country now being shut down okay how are we going to make sure that the kids do well in this crisis not become traumatized what do we do about the parents now who have to stay home with the kids and cant go to work,13
Bernie Sanders, i think what bottom line here is that in this crisis we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable that includes people who are in prison right now people who are in homeless shelters right now what about the half a million people who are homeless tonight whos going to respond to them now in 2008 when we had the wall street bailout they did very well for the people on top they bailed out the crooks on wall street but they forgot about the suffering of ordinary americans this time around let us learn that lesson let us pay attention to the working families in this country,13
Dana Bash, thank you senator,13
Bernie Sanders, we have the most vulnerable,13
Joe Biden, we have learned that lesson and again i lay out in detail what we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable we should have every single person thats in a nursing home being able to be tested we should be moving forces in to do that we should move in the capability to do that we should be sitting down the president should be sitting down in the situation room right now and doing what we did before and asking the question okay youre going to close everything well if you close everything how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled how do you make sure when you close that school those children are going to be able to get the school food program how do you make sure that youre going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid i propose that all of that be covered and its going to take a multimultibillion dollar program to do that but first things first the first thing is take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind,13
Joe Biden, take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind of capability we have to prevent this great bump in terms of how its going to cause such pain as well as moving in the direction of making sure we have a longterm plan to make sure its taken care,13
Dana Bash, thank you mr vice president were going to talk in a moment a lot more about the economic impact but first senator sanders i want to ask about china when this outbreak first started in china the government there censored the whistleblower doctor who sounded the alarm and downplayed the true gravity of the virus,13
Bernie Sanders, right,13
Dana Bash, what consequences should china face for its role in this global crisis,13
Bernie Sanders, well one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the american people you cannot be less than frank about the nature of the crisis and what bothers me very much is you have a president of the united states today mr trump who was praising china for the good work that they are doing when in fact as you indicated they were lying to their own people and allowing that  the case look i dont think this is the time for recrimination to be punishing people now is the time by the way to be working with china they are learning a lot about this crisis and in fact we have got to work with them weve got to work with the world health organization weve got to work with italy weve got to work with countries around the world if there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together got to support each other this is that moment,13
Joe Biden, if i may respond thats why i insisted the moment this broke out that we should insist on having our experts in china in china to see what was happening and make it clear to china thered be consequences if we did not have that access we have to lead the world we should be the ones doing what we did during the ebola crisis bringing the whole world together and saying this is what we must do we have to have a common plan all nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure and so this is we need world leadership we need international leadership we need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which were approaching this,13
Dana Bash, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, well the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis we have got to act in an unprecedented way and that means every country on earth is going to be affected every country on earth has got to work together it also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry we tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering this is a time for all of us working together the world health organization is a very very strong organization it is sad that we have a president that has ignored the international community in so many ways including in terms of international health crisis,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you senator sanders obviously another part of this story is the economy which is reeling from this pandemic many economists are warning of a recession just hours ago the federal reserve cut interest rates to near 0 which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008 vice president biden what would you do,13
Joe Biden, what i would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the united states that we are going to have to have a major major major bailout package that we do not reward corporations we reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here the problem is the policies of this administration economically have weve eaten a lot of our seed corn here the ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of 19 trillion by the fact that we have used the fed will be of little consequence now theyve already used what leverage they have and so were going to have to just level with the american people,13
Joe Biden, heres the deal were going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis economic crisis which is the most critical now to let people know their mortgages are going to be paid their rents are going to be paid theyre going to have childcare theyre going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this et cetera we have to go beyond that were going to have to be in a situation where were meeting on a daily basis like we did in the middle of the financial crisis to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it we hold all these folks harmless but not do what trump wants to do for example he came along and said i got a great idea lets well youre going to tell me,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, the ebola crisis in my view exposes the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system and how poorly prepared we are despite how much money that we spent the ebola crisis is also i think exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today we have more income and wealth inequality in america today than any time in 100 years and what that means then in the midst of this crisis you know if youre a multimillionaire no ones happy about this crisis youre going to get through it youre going to get everything you need youre not worried about healthcare youre not worried about income coming in,13
Bernie Sanders, half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck we got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table what is going to happen to them so the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of ebola keep talking about ebola you got ebola in my head here right now as a result of the virus here the coronavirus what we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little,13
Joe Biden, people are looking for results not a revolution they want to deal with the results they need right now and we can do that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt in terms of they lose their job in terms of not having the ability to care for their children in terms of the healthcare costs that they have related to this crisis we can make them whole now now and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole,13
Joe Biden, that has nothing to do with a legitimate concern about income equality in america thats real thats real but that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now so no ones thrown out of their home no one loses their mortgage no one is kicked out of their house no one loses their paycheck no one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this sars of this particular crisis,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you vice president senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, well i think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis but it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future so how does it happen that today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world half of our people are scared to death good i agree in fact that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis but god willing this crisis is going to end and we are going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table,13
Joe Biden, i dont disagree with that you were asking about the crisis what are we going to do about the crisis now which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of americans and its not going to be policy now its not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with healthcare its got to be solved with an emergency need right now right now what do we do first thing we do is we make sure that healthcare is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it and that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning secondly it requires us to be in a position where were anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the healthcare system by bringing the military along more hospital beds more training more equipment more equipment to save the first responders as well,13
Joe Biden, in addition to that we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today how about that person whos been laid off today how about that person who doesnt have an income today they have to know that tomorrow when the paycheck comes due you will get that paycheck and thirdly we have to think longterm about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again and then we move on then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now first things first,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you vice president senator sanders you voted against bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis,13
Joe Biden, yes,13
Ilia Calderón, many believe those spending bills were a crucial part of stabilizing the economy back then would you support bailouts for industries that are being crushed by the coronavirus outbreak now,13
Bernie Sanders, i did youre quite right i voted against the bailout because i believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on wall street should not be rewarded by a bailout and today by the way those banks are more prosperous and own more assets by and large than they did back then theyre bigger now than they were then i thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality the people on top there was surtax on the very wealthy should bail out and its not just the top bailout we gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks,13
Bernie Sanders, but to answer your question where we are right now we need to stabilize the economy but we cant repeat what we did in 2008 joe voted for that i voted against it because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies our job right now is to tell every working person in this country no matter what your income is you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, had those banks all gone under all those people bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble deep deep trouble all those little folks wed have gone out of business theyd find themselves in the position where they would lose everything that they had in that bank whether it was 10 or 300 or a savings account this was about saving an economy and it did save the economy and the banks paid back and they paid back with interest i agree with bernie some of them should have gone to jail that was the big disagreement i had in terms of bailing out but the question was they paid back in addition to that also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry saving thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobs over time he voted against that as well,13
Bernie Sanders, no i did not vote against that that bailout money was used later on by bush to protect the automobile industry but heres the point,13
Joe Biden, ,13
Bernie Sanders, one minute one minute heres the point here is that in terms of that bailout there are ways that you can bail out when you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals in this case on wall street you know what you say to them and i did i said this to the secretary of the treasury you want a bailout thats fine you have your friends pay for it not working people the other point is as joe should know it wasnt just the 700 billion tarp program the fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world that was essentially a grant because they then could sell that they can then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, look the fact of the matter is that if in fact the banks had all gone under we would be in a great depression how do you get out of that now bernies saying that i guess hes going to do a wealth tax or something that the top 1 could pay for everything and they should pay for everything that occurred we were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars thats what this was about and the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression after we passed the recovery act which i was the one went on got the three votes to get it changed that had 900 billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden im going to stay with you many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants and now even many legal immigrants in the united states are afraid to seek medical help how do you ensure they feel safe enough to get treatment to help stop the spread of coronavirus,13
Joe Biden, anyone who shows up to be tested for coronavirus or gets coronavirus treated would be held harmless just like ive argued all along any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband but shes an undocumented she cannot be deported because she reports there are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented person for and that would be one of them we want that its in the interests of everyone and those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there its even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly they will not should not under any circumstances be held accountable and be deported for that purpose period,13
Bernie Sanders, i have been criticized because the proposal for medicare for all that i introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered and right now we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing theyre sick they want to go to the doctor they dont want to spread this disease are now standing and thinking about whether ice is going to deport them so one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the healthcare that they need that should be a general principle above and beyond the coronavirus,13
Bernie Sanders, second of all weve got to end these terrible ice raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country and thirdly to answer your question the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those 11 million undocumented and furthermore on day one as president i would restore the legal status of the 18 million young people ,13
Dana Bash, senator senator thank you were going to talk about immigration in a minute but first i want to ask about something thats going on right now again back to this crisis we know that people over the age of 60 and those with underlying medical conditions especially heart disease lung disease and diabetes are the most vulnerable to coronavirus and are being asked to change their behavior to protect themselves so senator sanders ill start with you youre 78 years old you had a heart attack what are you doing to protect yourself,13
Bernie Sanders, well a great deal i mean last night we had a fireside chat not a rally i love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies i enjoy it very much were not doing that right now in fact our entire staff is working from home so on a personal level what were doing is im not shaking hands joe and i did not shake hands i am very careful about the people i am interacting with im using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that i do not get the infection and i have to say thank god right now i do not have any symptoms and i feel very grateful for that,13
Dana Bash, vice president biden youre 77 what are you doing to protect yourself,13
Joe Biden, well fortunately i dont have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that i have to worry about number one number two thank god for the time being anything can happen as my mother would say knock on wood that im in good health number three im taking all the precautions anyone would take whether theyre 30 years old or 60 years old or 80 years old that is im going to make sure that i do not shake hands any longer i do not engage we did the same thing our staff is all working from home we are not doing rallies any longer were doing virtual rallies were doing virtual town hall meetings,13
Joe Biden, were in a situation where now i do not as i said when we encounter people were not going into crowds and so im taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking i wash my hands god knows how many times a day with hot water and soap i carry with me as a matter of fact i have it in my bag outside here hand sanitizer i dont know how many times a day i use that i make sure i dont touch my face and so on so im taking all the precautions weve told everybody else to take,13
Jake Tapper, lets turn to the race more broadly now throughout this campaign youve each laid out starkly different visions for how to bring about change vice president biden senator sanders is calling for a political revolution you said people want results not a revolution make the case for why a revolution is not what the country needs or wants,13
Joe Biden, we have problems we have to solve now now whats a revolution going to do disrupt everything in the meantime look the senator talks about his medicare for all he still hasnt told you how hes going to ever get it past he hasnt told you how in fact theres any possibility of that happening he hadnt told you how much its going to cost he hadnt tell you how its going to apply it doesnt kick in for four years even after it passes we want a revolution lets act now pass the biden healthcare plan which takes obamacare restores all the cuts made to it subsidize it further provide for lower drug prices make sure that theres no hidden bills make sure that we invest what i want to invest 50 billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence diabetes alzheimers and cancer,13
Joe Biden, make sure that we have a medicare option thats in a public option providing medicare for us we can do that now i can get that passed i can get that done if im president of the united states of america that will be a fundamental change and it happens now i can tell you from experience being a significant consumer of healthcare with my sons my family all the things weve gone through what people want is hope and they need it now not four years from now bernie still hasnt told us how hes going to pay for it,13
Bernie Sanders, not quite true,13
Joe Biden, were talking about a 30plus trillion plan,13
Bernie Sanders, not quite true,13
Jake Tapper, senator,13
Bernie Sanders, look lets do something that is very rarely done in the congress lets do something that the media does lets talk about the reality of american life why is it that over the last 45 years despite the huge increase in productivity and technology the average worker todays making a nickel more in real dollars why is it that over the last 30 years the richest 1 have seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth bottom half of america 900 billion decline in their wealth,13
Bernie Sanders, the bottom half of america 900 billion decline in their wealth why is it that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave why do we give tax breaks to billionaires when a halfamillion people are homeless today and it comes down to something jake we dont talk about the power structure in america who has the power ill tell you who has the power its the people who contribute money the billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns who control the legislative agenda those people have the power,13
Bernie Sanders, if you want to make real changes in this country if you want to create an economy that works for all not just the few if you want to guarantee quality healthcare to all not make 100 billion in profit for the healthcare industry you know what you need you need to take on wall street you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry you dont take campaign contributions from them you take them on and create an economy that works for all,13
Joe Biden, you want to do that do what i proposed over 30 years ago federally fund all elections my whole healthcare plan by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains people should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is and not at 20 that would raise 800 billion to pay for my entire medical healthcare plan which would cover everyone,13
Joe Biden, the fact of the matter is everything i call for i pay for and i do not believe and i have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy i strongly opposed the tax cut that this president has put through of 1 trillion 900 billion i said at the time this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net,13
Joe Biden, look the idea that bernie implies the way he says things speaking of negative ads my lord bernie youre running ads saying im opposed to social security the politifact says its a flat lie and that the washington post said is a flat lie,13
Bernie Sanders, oh well let me ask you a question joe,13
Joe Biden, yeah,13
Bernie Sanders, youre right here with me,13
Joe Biden, yeah,13
Bernie Sanders, have you been on the floor of the senate you were in the senate for a few years,13
Joe Biden, yeah,13
Bernie Sanders, time and time again talking about the necessity with pride about cutting social security cutting medicare cutting veterans programs,13
Joe Biden, no,13
Bernie Sanders, you never said that,13
Joe Biden, no,13
Bernie Sanders, all right america go to the website right now go to the youtube right now time after time you were not a fan of bowlessimpson,13
Joe Biden, i was not a fan of bowles,13
Bernie Sanders, you were not a fan of the balanced budget amendment which called for cuts in social security come on joe you were,13
Joe Biden, look heres the deal,13
Bernie Sanders, youre an honest guy why dont you just tell the truth here we all make mistakes,13
Joe Biden, i am telling the truth you said that i in fact why am i rated 96 by the social security organizations why am i viewed as a strong,13
Bernie Sanders, organizations,13
Joe Biden, i have laid out how i will increase social security benefits,13
Bernie Sanders, thats good i laid that out,13
Joe Biden, i have laid out how i am going to make sure that it is in fact paid for,13
Bernie Sanders, jake,13
Joe Biden, go to joebidencom look at my exchange with paul ryan on his desire to try to privatize andor cut social security and understand how he manipulated it,13
Bernie Sanders, all right joe let me repeat it again i want you just to be straight with the american people i am saying that you have been on the floor of the senate time and time again talking about the need to cut social security medicare and veterans programs is that true or is that not true,13
Joe Biden, no its not true,13
Bernie Sanders, that is not true,13
Joe Biden, that is not true what is true is in terms of the negotiations that are taking place how to deal with the deficit everything was on the table i did not support any of those cuts and social security or in veterans benefits,13
Bernie Sanders, whoa whoa whoa everything was on the table all right youre right you just said it including in your judgment cuts to social security and veterans,13
Joe Biden, in order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related but we did not cut it i did not vote for it,13
Bernie Sanders, i know because people like me helped stop that but joe you just contradict,13
Joe Biden, come on bernie,13
Bernie Sanders, joe you just contradicted yourself one minute excuse me one minute you said i was not on the floor the next minute you say well yes there was a reason why i was worried about the deficit maybe thats good reason maybe its not all that i am saying is you were prepared to cut and advocated for the cuts of programs,13
Joe Biden, lets just i did not i never voted to cut social security,13
Bernie Sanders, im not talking about voting joe thats not what i said,13
Joe Biden, i never voted well look i voted to protect it just go look at the debate with paul ryan for the vice presidency look at what i did and bernie will you acknowledge your campaign took out of context that whole exchange between paul ryan are you saying politifact is wrong are you saying,13
Bernie Sanders, yeah well believe me the washington post politifact is wrong a whole lot of times,13
Joe Biden, are they wrong on that bernie are they wrong on that bernie,13
Bernie Sanders, joe,13
Joe Biden, bernie did you miss,13
Bernie Sanders, joe did you wait a minute ill answer your question you answer mine,13
Joe Biden, i answered yours,13
Bernie Sanders, no you didnt,13
Joe Biden, all right,13
Bernie Sanders, one more time were you on the floor time and time again for whatever reason talking about the need to cut social security and medicare and veterans programs,13
Joe Biden, no i did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs,13
Bernie Sanders, okay all that i would say to the american people go to youtube its all over the place joe said it many many times im surprised you can defend it or change your mind on it but you cant deny the reality,13
Dana Bash, so senator because you brought up social security and you have been talking about it i want to ask you about something that you wrote in 1996 you were a member of the house and you wrote an op ed that said it is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments in social security taxes and benefits,13
Bernie Sanders, yeah,13
Dana Bash, why are your past comments any less relevant than the vice presidents,13
Bernie Sanders, incremental adjustments are what i advocated adjustments that i advocated and have advocated for years is among other things increasing the cost of living assistance no youre not going to find me ever calling for cuts to social security right now for example we determine colas by looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for healthcare thats what i was talking about,13
Bernie Sanders, i have in fact when joe and others were enamored with the socalled bowlessimpson effort which included cuts to social security or raising the retirement age i formed along with people like barbara boxer the defending social security caucus to say no when 20 of our seniors who are trying to get by on 13000 a year or more we are not going to cut social security,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden yesterday you endorsed an elizabeth warren plan that would undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in 2005 a few hours ago you announced support for making public college tuition free for families who make less than 125 000 a year something senator sanders has supported what changed,13
Joe Biden, two things number one lets talk about the bankruptcy bill the bankruptcy bill was passing overwhelmingly and i improved it i had a choice it was going to pass and a republican president republican congress i offered two amendments to make sure that people under 50000 would not be affected and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments thats what i did it passed overwhelmingly i did not like the rest of the bill but i improved it number one,13
Joe Biden, number two ive talked with senator warren about her proposal this is the first opportunity weve had to make substantial change in what we couldnt get done in a republican administration thats why we talked last two nights ago and i supported her proposal its a good proposal its a solid proposal she should get credit for having introduced it,13
Joe Biden, with regard to what were talking about in terms of college education ive been saying for a long time that were in a position where 12 years of education is not enough is not enough for the 21st century we need 16 years of education the exact bill that senator sanders introduced i guess a little over a year ago capping it off at 125000 in income you could get free up to that point after that youd have to pay for your college education it only worked for public schools and it would work for public universities in your state i support that idea it was a good idea and i support it thats what it is im not saying everything bernies said has been wrong he happens to be right on that one,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders i assume you welcome these changes,13
Bernie Sanders, look this is a little bit about leadership as well joe talked about bankruptcy joe if my memory is correct you helped write that bankruptcy bill,13
Joe Biden, i did not,13
Bernie Sanders, all right,13
Joe Biden, i did not,13
Bernie Sanders, that bankruptcy bill by the way when we talk about education we got 45 million people in america struggling with student debt some of them really struggling with student debt that bankruptcy bill made it impossible very difficult for people to escape from that student debt it was a very very bad bill you said joe that a majority of the people in the senate voted for it youre right,13
Joe Biden, overwhelming majority,13
Bernie Sanders, overwhelmingly well i voted against it in the house and i was right i dont have to rethink my position because thats what leadership is about having the guts to take an unpopular vote but its not just bankruptcy the difference between joe and i on higher education is four years ago it was not a popular idea joe glad youre coming around now four years ago when i said that public colleges and universities should be tuition free people were saying bernie thats a radical idea well you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction,13
Bernie Sanders, im glad that joe was on board but what leadership is about is going forward when its not popular when its an idea that you get criticized for so im proud of that fact and im proud of my leadership on many issues joe since the campaign has come around i talked about raising that minimum wage 15bucksanhour four years ago joe,13
Joe Biden, so did i and i went out and campaigned for it,13
Bernie Sanders, 15 an hour,13
Joe Biden, 15 an hour in new york city go to the governor,13
Bernie Sanders, i will talk to the governor i am not aware of it i am not aware of it,13
Joe Biden, you should be aware of it,13
Bernie Sanders, all right four years ago it was a radical idea very few people in congress were talking about it,13
Ilia Calderón, go ahead vice president,13
Joe Biden, well here look lets get something straight about the bankruptcy bill the bankruptcy bill already it did not affect student debt for 90 because the law had already been passed you could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions you couldnt do it as the bankruptcy bill did not affect that it affected 10 of the people the first bankruptcy bill 10 of the student loans number one,13
Joe Biden, number two now were in a position where were able to correct that problem the fact is if i hadnt stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than 50000 those who for alimony and child support then guess what they would have been in the bucket too it was going to pass anyway i made it let me finish i made incrementally better i did not like the bill i did not support the bill and i made it clear to the industry i didnt like the bill,13
Joe Biden, number two this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldnt correct in the bill the first time around that is why i support elizabeth warrens idea and its a very good idea,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders go ahead,13
Bernie Sanders, well this is kind of circular logic were going to reform the bill that i voted for well if you hadnt voted for it and if you rallied other people as i tried to do in the house voting against it we might not have the problems with it we have today what leadership is about joe it deals whether your opposition or your support i should say for legislation regarding gay communities and the socalled defense of marriage act you remember that bill right you remember,13
Joe Biden, yes i do,13
Bernie Sanders, gay marriage today is considered a little bit differently than it was 25 years ago i remember that vote it was a very hard vote i voted against the defense of marriage act you voted for it i voted against the bankruptcy bill you voted for it i voted against the war in iraq which was also a tough vote you voted for i voted against disastrous trade agreements like nafta and pnt all with china which costs this country over four million good paying jobs you voted for it i voted against the hyde amendment which denies low income women the right to get an abortion you have consistently voted for it i dont know what your position is on it today but you have consistently voted for it in other words all that im saying here we can argue about the merits of the bill,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden,13
Bernie Sanders, it takes courage sometimes to do the right thing,13
Joe Biden, we can argue about the past and the future this man voted against the brady bill five times background checks background checks five times number one number two this man is the only one of the few democrats i know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued talk about a special special interest we should be able to sue drug companies we should be able to sue tobacco companies we cannot sue the gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago he says it was a mistake now im prepared to accept he says its a mistake,13
Joe Biden, the question is what do we do from this point on and by the way i might add im the first person to go on national television in any administration and say i supported gay marriage i supported gay marriage when asked it started a ripple effect for gay marriage on national television,13
Bernie Sanders, all that im saying here,13
Joe Biden, leadership,13
Bernie Sanders, we could argue this or that bill but what im suggesting is that in this time of crisis when we live in a really really unsettling world economically from a healthcare prospective with the coronavirus the people of america know my record okay,13
Bernie Sanders, for 30 years i have stood with the working families of this country i have taken on every special interest there is out there and that is what i will do in the white house thats a very different record than joes,13
Joe Biden, that is not a different record than mine,13
Bernie Sanders, that is a totally different record than yours all right i mean its manifested in this campaign when youre getting all this money from wealthy people and billionaires i think if you want somebody who will take to the white house what i have done for my whole life,13
Jake Tapper, thank you senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, and that is take on special interest i think im that candidate,13
Joe Biden, the average campaign contribution 44,13
Jake Tapper, lets talk about the future vice president biden if you become the democratic presidential nominee how will you appeal to supporters of senator sanders when you do disagree on so many issues,13
Joe Biden, hes making it hard for me right now i was trying to give him credit for some things he wont even take the credit for things he wants to do look i think that i want to make it clear that bernie as a nominee i will not only support him i will campaign for him i believe the people who support me will do the same thing because the existential threat to the united states of america is donald trump its critical i would hope that bernie would do the same thing if i am the nominee and encourage all of his followers to in fact support me as well because its much bigger than either of us character of the nation is on the ballot it goes well beyond whether or not senator sanders and i both agree we need medic healthcare should be a right not a privilege we both agree we have to deal with student debt we both agree we have to deal with education and access to education we both agree that we have a new green deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity we disagree on the detail of how we do it but we dont disagree on the principle we fundamentally disagree with this president on everything this is a man who wants to cut social security cut medicare not bernie the president of the united states so this is much bigger than whether or not im the nominee or bernies the nominee we must defeat donald trump he is the four more years of donald trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation weve got to restore this countrys soul thats essential as long as this president is there were not going to be able to that,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders if,13
Bernie Sanders, can i just say a word then ill respond to you,13
Jake Tapper, well its just a quick question,13
Bernie Sanders, yeah,13
Jake Tapper, which is if he is the nominee vicepresident biden youve already said you would support him,13
Bernie Sanders, of course,13
Jake Tapper, but will you campaign for him will you urge your supporters to,13
Bernie Sanders, on day one when i announced my candidacy what i said is this country cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar was running a corrupt administration or obviously doesnt know the constitution of the united states who believes hes above law was a racist and a sexist and a homophobe he is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,13
Bernie Sanders, what i said on day one joe day one that obviously i hope to win the nomination but if i dont win the nomination i and i think every other democratic candidate is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat donald trump,13
Bernie Sanders, but let me respond to something that joe said we talk about the green new deal and all of these things in general terms but details make a difference what i have said throughout this campaign and i dont think ive heard you say this yet joe is that if were going to save this planet for our kids and future generations we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their shortterm profits are not more important than the future of this planet we have a very detailed planet a detailed proposal happy to get the endorsement of the sunrise movement,13
Dr. Sanjay Gupta,  gupta and this is cnn,13
Dana Bash, welcome back to the cnnunivision democratic presidential debate live from washington dc and as we noted arizona will vote on tuesday we solicited questions from undecided democratic voters there one is from amy langenfeld who is a law professor from chandler arizona with a question for senator sanders,13
Amy Langenfeld, women are the canaries in the coal mine of the conservative agenda our access to healthcare is at risk  from the federalist societys remaking of the courts our lives are threatened by abusive partners access to guns women are disproportionately affected by bail requirements social security cuts and cuts to public education how will your cabinet ensure the best advice on issues that affect womens physical and financial health thank you,13
Bernie Sanders, my cabinet my administration will look like america last i heard over half of the people in america are women and that will be the representation in my cabinet and my administration and in terms of policies unlike joe i have consistently believed and i have a 100 lifetime voting record from groups like naral that it is a womens right to control her own body not the government i have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country i have aggressively and i think effectively made the case that we cannot have women in america earning 80 cents on the dollar compared to men and if youre a minority woman its 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,13
Bernie Sanders, we need to have universal affordable highquality childcare so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of so i think if you look at my agenda which is on berniesanderscom what you will find it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women who today are under incredible political assault by trump and republican governors all across this country,13
Dana Bash, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, am i able to respond to that,13
Dana Bash, please,13
Joe Biden, yes thank you number one i agree with the question and the underlying premise of amys question number one i commit it that if im elected president and have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts ill appoint the first black woman to the courts its required that they have representation now its long overdue secondly if im elected president my cabinet my administration will look like the country and i commit that ill pick a woman to be vice president there are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow i would pick a woman to be my vice president,13
Joe Biden, number three im the guy that wrote the domestic violence law and im the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun period they should not be able to own a gun i would get the boyfriend exception amended now ive gotten it past that if you are to get a stay away order from a court you have a child with someone that you cannot own a gun no one should be able in a gun who has abused a woman period,13
Dana Bash, mr vice president if i could just follow up just to be clear you just committed here tonight that your running mate if you get the nomination will be a woman,13
Joe Biden, yes,13
Dana Bash, senator sanders will you make that same statement,13
Bernie Sanders, may i just respond,13
Dana Bash, please,13
Bernie Sanders,  and ask joe a question right now a womans right to control her own body is under massive assault unprecedented assault,13
Joe Biden, it is,13
Bernie Sanders, joe you have in the past on more than one occasion voted for the hyde amendment which says that a woman lowincome woman could not use medicaid funding for an abortion is that still your view or have you modified it,13
Joe Biden, it is not my view it is not my view and by the way everybody whos been in the congress voted for the hyde amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bills the reason why i affirmatively came out opposed to the hyde amendment was that if were going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have hyde amendment a woman who doesnt have the money could not have coverage under healthcare,13
Bernie Sanders, well im glad,13
Joe Biden, number two and i did that a while ago okay number one number two i would send immediately to the desk of the united states congress when im elected president if im elected president a codification of roe v wade amended by casey because i think it is a womans right to choose i think its a womans opportunity to be able to make that decision and in fact ive gotten a 100 rating from naral as well,13
Dana Bash, senator sanders before we move on i just want to get you to respond,13
Bernie Sanders, excuse me you have a lifetime 100 voting record from naral,13
Joe Biden, i know my record of late from naral has been 100 i dont know whether it was 25 years ago,13
Bernie Sanders, well all right i mean i think one of the differences not to pick a bone here is i have been consistent ive always believed in that and you have not im glad youve changed your views,13
Dana Bash, senator just to be clear the vice president committed to picking a woman as his running mate if you get the nomination will you,13
Bernie Sanders, in all likelihood i will for me its not just nominating a woman it is making sure that we have a progressive women and there are progressive women out there so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction,13
Ilia Calderón, lets turn now to immigration vice president biden you recently said for the first time that the obamabiden administration made a big mistake in deporting millions of immigrants but you didnt publicly speak out against it at the time what commitment will you make tonight that as president you wont deport millions again,13
Joe Biden, number one i said that it took much too long to get it right and the president did get it right by daca as well as making sure that it tried to protect parents as well and by the way moving on an immigration bill as well the fact is that we already had a vote on immigration bill by the way and bernie voted against it the immigration bill had he voted forward and had passed wed already have 6 million undocumented would be citizens as i speak right now but i will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires access to citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks number one number two the first hundred days of my administration no one no one will be deported at all from that point on the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the united states of america,13
Ilia Calderón, so to be clear only felons get deported and everyone else gets,13
Joe Biden, period,13
Ilia Calderón,  to stay,13
Joe Biden, yes and the reason,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders,13
Joe Biden, is its about uniting families its about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent,13
Bernie Sanders, let me respond and ill answer your question let me respond to joes comments about the 2007 immigration bill that bill was opposed by lulac the largest latino organization in america the southern poverty law center called its guestworker programs akin to slavery there wasnt really a vote on the bill it was killed because there was a vote on the dorgan amendment i think it was 4948 and you know who voted with me on that one joe barack obama he understood that that proposal was a bad idea we dont need slavery in america where workers guestworkers are forced to say with their employers,13
Bernie Sanders, but in terms of immigration in general let me outline some of the things that we do day one we restore the legal status of 18 million young people and their parents in the daca program number two immediately we end these ice raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country three we changed the border policy under my administration no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers and fourth i think we can pass what the american people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform path towards citizenship for the 11 million undocumented,13
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, senator sanders critics suggest positions like this send a message that when a democrat is in the white house the border is open do they,13
Bernie Sanders, no thats just i mean thats what trump says and that is a total lie what were talking about is a humane sensible policy supported by the american people nobody is talking about open borders and of course trump lies about that but the bottom line is right now you have in this country people who have been here for decades they are working hard theyre raising their kids they are an important part of our agricultural economy our construction economy these are good people and yet they are living in terror and we have got to end that terror and end the ice raids and move toward a path towards citizenship,13
Joe Biden, let me set the record straight on something what was said you know the idea that it was slavery barack obama supported that immigration bill teddy kennedy supported that immigration bill i supported it i doubt whether those people think its slavery and by the way right after his vote against that he went on the lou dobbs show and continued to canard that theyre taking jobs these immigrants are taking jobs from americans which is one of the republican canards right after that no vote and so come on this is you think ted kennedy is for slavery you think i was for slavery you think people voted for it for slavery,13
Bernie Sanders, just,13
Joe Biden, and with regard to your question relative to whether or not i would deal with supporting the border look we can deal with securing the border by national technical means all the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now we dont need a wall and by the way i would immediately as president surge to the border i would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river in a desperate situation they should be able to come to the united states and have a judgment made is whether or not they qualify i would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately and no one no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, thats kind of what ive been saying throughout the entire campaign,13
Joe Biden, so have i,13
Bernie Sanders, so what we need is at the border hundreds of administrative judges we need to deal with people who are seeking asylum based on international law we need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up we need a humane border policy and ill tell you what else we need and i speak as the son of an immigrant my father came to this country from poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket couldnt speak english didnt have much of an education i will end on day one the demonization the ugly demonization from the white house of the immigrant community in this country weve got a president who is trying to divide us up my administration brings our people together black and white and latino native american asian american,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you senator sanders vice president biden you opposed sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007 where do you stand now should undocumented immigrants arrested by local police be turned over to immigration officials,13
Joe Biden, no,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, of course not look and one of the things that goes on when you have that process is that not only the psychological terror and ive talked to these kids kids are scared to death in america when they come home from school that their mom or dad may not be there may be deported what we need to do is to end and i will end this on day one the ice raids that have been so harmful to so many people and we need to do again what the american people want us to do im the son of an immigrant this is a country significantly built by immigrant labor built by slave labor and what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and the divisiveness this coming from the trump administration,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders,13
Joe Biden, can i add one thing to that please,13
Jake Tapper, go ahead,13
Joe Biden, look we are a nation of immigrants our future rests upon the latino community being fully integrated 24 out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a latino right now today the idea that any american thinks it doesnt pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion because if we do not invest everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will in fact get worse not better we should be embracing bringing them in just like what happened with the irish immigrants after the famine just what happened with the italians et cetera weve been through this before xenophobia is a disease,13
Jake Tapper, thank you vice president biden lets move now to the climate crisis im coming right to you senator sanders the world health organization calls the climate crisis a health crisis and warns that climate change could fuel the spread of infectious diseases can you point to specific measures in your climate plan that address that threat,13
Bernie Sanders, well of course we do i mean we look this is what the scientists are telling us the same scientists who make your point there jake what theyre telling us is if we dont get our act together in the next seven or eight years there would be irreversible damage done to this planet were talking about cities in america from miami to new orleans to charleston south carolina being underwater we are talking about severe droughts which will prevent farmers in the midwest from growing the food that we need were talking about extreme weather disturbances which hit houston texas venice italy just a few months ago,13
Bernie Sanders, we are talking about the absolute need and i want to hear joes position on this this is not a middle of the ground thing this is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines what this is about is transforming our energy system as quickly as we humanly can away from fossil fuel it is insane that we continue to have fracking in america it is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry this has got the end and end now if we love our kids and future generations,13
Jake Tapper, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, first thing that president obama and i were summoned to the state department excuse me the defense department for was to meet with all the chiefs the single greatest threat to our national security they said is climate change single greatest threat to our national security because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are because their islands are sinking because you saw what happened in darfur with the change in weather patterns and the deserted there it causes war it causes great migrations great migrations they said thats the single biggest problem number two theres an awful lot of people today who are in fact getting ill because of the changes in the environment particularly up where bernie lives im not it has nothing to do with him but having up in the northeast because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well in addition to eliminating foliage but,13
Jake Tapper, so vice president biden let me ask you then you talk about this being the number one crisis,13
Joe Biden, yes,13
Jake Tapper,  they told you at the pentagon the price tag for your climate plan is about 17 trillion thats about 14 trillion less than senator sanders wants to spend on this is your plan ambitious enough to tackle this crisis,13
Joe Biden, yes it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis because what go to joebidencom i lay out the first 13 things i would do immediately upon being elected number one were going to once again reinstate all the cuts the president made and everything from the cafe standards how far automobiles can go investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road making sure were in a position where we are now in a position that we put 500000 charging stations in areas that  and the federal government paying for transportation the vehicles we run all of those being converted to being able to run on low carbon fuel andor be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all carbon free we can do these things we can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next president or the following president the one beyond that,13
Joe Biden, in addition to that we also have to i would immediately rejoin the paris climate accord which i helped put together i would call the 100 nations over a hundred nations but the hundred major polluters to the united states and the first hundred days to up the ante and make it clear that in fact if they didnt thered be a price to pay and lastly i would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world to provide 20 billion for the amazon for brazil no longer to burn the amazon so they could have forests theyre no longer forests but they could have farming and say this is what were going to do  the region is burning out than we admit in one entire year per year,13
Jake Tapper, thank you mr vice president senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, all well and good but nowhere near enough i mean you mentioned we started this debate talking about a warlike situation in terms of the coronavirus and we said we have to act accordingly you said it i think youre right i said it we have to act dramatically boldly if were going to save lives in this country and around the world i look at climate change in exactly the same way its not a question of reentering the paris accord thats fine who cares its not a big deal the deal right now is do we have the courage and this gets back to the point im trying to make all night long do we take on the healthcare industry and tell them their profits are not more important than healthcare for all do we take on the fossil fuel industry,13
Bernie Sanders, look in terms of the fossil fuel industry these guys have been lying theyve been lying for years like the tobacco industry lied 50 years ago oh we dont know if fossil fuels if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change they knew exxonmobil knew they lied in fact i think they should be held criminally accountable but this jake is an issue of enormous consequence what joe was saying goes nowhere near enough its not a question of money give me a minute here we have time to talk about this this is a world shaking event,13
Jake Tapper, i understand i just want to give him a chance to respond and then we can come back to you,13
Bernie Sanders, okay fine lets stay on,13
Jake Tapper, were staying on this issue,13
Joe Biden, number one no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry no more drilling on federal lands no more drilling including offshore no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill period ends number one number two were in a situation as well where we cannot we are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion the fact that he says climate change paris accord doesnt mean much we could get everything exactly right were 15 of the problem 85 of the problem is over there we need someone who can deal internationally we need someone who can bring the together again we need someone who can move in a direction that in fact if you violate the commitment you make you will pay an economic price for it like whats happening in china there theyre exporting coal significant coal,13
Jake Tapper, thank you,13
Bernie Sanders, okay look obviously the paris accord is useful but it doesnt go anywhere if youre laughing joe then youre missing the point,13
Joe Biden, youre missing the point,13
Bernie Sanders, this is an existential crisis,13
Joe Biden, bingo,13
Bernie Sanders, you talk about im talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can im talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet no ifs buts and maybes about it im talking about speaking,13
Joe Biden, so am i,13
Bernie Sanders,  to china well im not sure your proposal does that im talking about speaking to china to russia to countries all over the world and in this moment making the point that instead of spending 18 trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change i know your heart is in the right place but this requires dramatic bold action weve got to take on the fossil fuel industry your plan does not do that,13
Joe Biden, my plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world he just got finished saying whats he going to do hes going to bring these countries together making it clear to them im saying we bring them together make them live up to the commitments if they dont live up to the commitments they pay a financial price for it they pay an economic price for it because we can do everything my state is three feet above sea level i dont need a lecture on whats going to happen about rising seas i know what happens i watched the whole delmarva peninsula just like it is in south carolina and the rest something i know a little bit about i wrote the first climate change bill that was in the congress which politifact said was a game changer im the guy who came along and said with dick lugar that were going to trade well forgive your debt if you dont cut down your fars ive been way ahead of this curve this idea that all of a sudden bernie found this out is amazing to me,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, no bernie didnt find it out bernie is listening to the scientists and what youre talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments those commitments are not enough what this moment is about joe is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis they were wrong the problem is more severe so all that im saying right here is that we are fighting for the future of this planet for the wellbeing of our kids and future generations you cannot continue as i understand joe believes to continue fracking correct me if im wrong what we need to do right now is bringing the world together tell the fossil fuel industry that we are going to move aggressively to win solar sustainable energies,13
Jake Tapper, thank you,13
Bernie Sanders,  and energy efficiency,13
Jake Tapper, thank you senator,13
Joe Biden, no more no new fracking and by the way on the recovery act i was able to make sure we invested 90 billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind that is lower than the price of coal thats why not another new coal plant will be built i did that while you were watching number one number two were in a situation where we in fact have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the dynamic and thats why we should be talking about things like ive been talking about for years high speed rail taking millions of automobiles off the road making sure that we move in a direction where no more no more drilling on federal lands making sure that we invest in changing the entire fleet,13
Jake Tapper, thank you,13
Joe Biden,  of the united states military to i know,13
Jake Tapper, thank you mr vice president senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, can i respond,13
Jake Tapper,  i want to talk to you about fracking because you want to ban fracking,13
Bernie Sanders, yes,13
Jake Tapper,  which is a method of extracting natural gas the shift towards natural gas and away from coal has resulted in reduced us carbon emissions so how can the us transition to your targeted goal is zero emissions with fracking completely out of the picture,13
Bernie Sanders, because we have to invest in an unprecedented way in an unprecedented way you started off by saying that were talking about a 13 14 trillion investment that is a lot of money and ive been criticized for that but i dont know what the alternative is if we are playing for the future of this planet so weve got to be dramatic and what being dramatic is massive investments in wind in solar and sustainable energies in general and research and development in making our buildings all over this country in my state of vermont and around this country got a lot of old buildings we can put millions,13
Jake Tapper, welcome back to the cnn univision democratic presidential debate on tuesday voters in arizona ohio illinois and florida will cast their votes in the democratic primary heres univisions ilia calderón,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you jake lets move now to foreign policy senator sanders there are about 15 million cuban americans living in florida right now why would they vote for you when they hear you praise a program of fidel castro a dictator who jailed tortured and killed thousands of cubans,13
Bernie Sanders, i have opposed or authoritarianism whether its in cuba whether its in saudi arabia whether its in china or whether it is in russia that is my life record i believe unlike the president of the united states in democracy not authoritarianism in cuba or any place else,13
Bernie Sanders, what i believe right now in this world is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism thats what putin in russia is leading thats what mbs in saudi arabia is leading and as president of the united states unlike donald trump i will put the flag down and say that in this country and in this world we have got a move toward democracy and human rights that is my view and has always been my view,13
Ilia Calderón, to be clear senator sanders cuba has been a dictatorship for decades shouldnt we judge dictators by the violation of human rights and not by any of their alleged achievements,13
Bernie Sanders, well i think you can make the same point about china china is undoubtedly an authoritarian society okay but would anybody deny any economists deny that extreme poverty in china today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago thats a fact so i think we condemn authoritarianism whether its in china russia cuba any place else but to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would i think be incorrect,13
Ilia Calderón, vice president biden you have criticized senator sanders for bracing castros education system but in 2016 president obama said cuba made a great progress in educating young people and that its healthcare system is a huge achievement that they should be congratulated for how is that different from what senator sanders has said,13
Joe Biden, he was trying to change cuban policies so the cuban people would get out from under the thumb of the castro and his brother that is to change the policy so that we can impact on cubas policy by getting them opened up that was about but the praising of the sandinistas the praising of cuba the praising just now of china china is an authoritarian dictatorship thats what it is we have to deal with them because theyre there,13
Joe Biden, but the idea that they in fact have increased the wealth of people in that country its been marginal that change thats taken place it is still they have a million uyghurs a million muslims in prison camps in the west you see whats happening in hong kong today and by the way the idea that he praised the soviet union when it was the soviet union about the things that they had done well they are an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people,13
Joe Biden, and in addition to that we have a circumstance where after the election was all over and we knew what was done by the russians now and interfering with our elections this man voted against sanctioning russia for interference in our elections,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders,13
Joe Biden, i dont get it,13
Bernie Sanders, well what you dont get in this is exactly what the problem with politics is about all right question did china make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last 50 years thats a no,13
Joe Biden, thats like saying jack the ripper,13
Bernie Sanders, no its not joe,13
Joe Biden, yes it is,13
Bernie Sanders, you see joe this is the problem,13
Joe Biden, yes it is,13
Bernie Sanders, this is the problem we cant talk  i know theres a political line i understand chinas terrible awful nothing ever good  but the fact of the matter is china of course is an authoritarian state its what i just said,13
Joe Biden, its a dictatorship,13
Bernie Sanders, thats what i just said five minutes ago and by the way the question that was asked quoted barack obama president obama was more generous in his praise of what cuba did in healthcare and education than i was i was talking about a program 60 years ago in the first year of the castro revolution,13
Bernie Sanders, so the bottom line is that i think its a little bit absurd if were going to look at the world the way it is of course we are opposed to authoritarian and by the way before it was considered good policy good idea i was condemning the dictatorship in saudi arabia when a lot of other people in washington,13
Joe Biden, with me,13
Bernie Sanders, i was condemning the dictatorship in the uae you were not,13
Bernie Sanders, yes i was,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you senator sanders vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, look the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing the idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is in fact makes our allies wonder whats going on what do you think the south koreans think when he praises china like that what do you think the australians believe in the shadow of china what do you think is happening in indonesia in the shadow of china what do you think is happening in terms of japan in the shadow of china words matter these are flat out dictators period and they should be called for it straight up we may have to work out,13
Joe Biden, for example i was able to help negotiate a new start agreement with russia not because i like putin the guy is a thug,13
Jake Tapper, mr vice president sticking with foreign policy you acknowledge that your support and vote for the iraq war was a mistake what lessons did you learn from that mistake and how might those lessons influence your foreign policy decision making as president,13
Joe Biden, i learned i cant take the word of a president when in fact they assured me that they would not use force remember the context the context was the united nations security council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determine whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction they were not,13
Joe Biden, and whats the first thing that happened when we got elected the president obama turned to me and said get those troops out of the hours responsible for getting 150000 combat troops out of iraq i admitted 14 years ago was in  to have trusted him and im prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week,13
Bernie Sanders, okay lets start off with the war in iraq joe i was there too i was in the house i understood  and by the way lets be clear about what that vote was and you were there at the signing ceremony with bush everybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution you were giving bush the authority to go to war and everybody knew thats exactly what he and cheney wanted to do,13
Bernie Sanders, most people who followed that issue closely understood that the bush administration was lying through its teeth with regard to saddam having weapons of mass destruction i understood that i was on the floor of the house time and time again but the issue is not just the war in iraq that was a long time ago the issue is the trade agreement what is it so easy for me to lead the effort against disastrous trade agreements,13
Bernie Sanders, the issue was the bankruptcy bill that you supported the issue was the hyde amendment the issue is the defense of marriage act the issue is whether or not in difficult times and god knows these are difficult times were going to have the courage to take on powerful special interest and do whats right for the working families of this country,13
Jake Tapper, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, why did you vote not to sanction the russians,13
Bernie Sanders, you know why because i had every  you keep talking about iran that was tied to iran russia was in iran i think john kerry indicated his support for what i did that was undermining the iranian agreement thats why,13
Joe Biden, thats not true our ,13
Bernie Sanders, thats why and thats the only reason why i have condemned russia time and time again,13
Jake Tapper, vice president biden,13
Joe Biden, the fact is that the idea that i in fact supported the things that you suggested is not accurate look im the guy that helped put together the iran deal and got the inspectors in there my chief of staff was the guy my foreign policy guy doing that negotiation i was the guy that helped put together a 60nation organization to take on the isis in iraq and in syria ive dealt with these folks i know them and i know what theyre like and i know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are,13
Joe Biden, the fact is this bernies notion about how he embraces folks like the sandinistas and cuba and the former soviet union and talks about the good things they did in china is absolutely contrary to every message we want to send the rest of the world,13
Jake Tapper, senator sanders,13
Bernie Sanders, i have led the effort against all forms of authoritarianism including americas socalled allies in the uae and in saudi arabia and in fact as you may know worked with conservative republicans to utilize for the very first time the war powers act to get the united states out of the horrific war in yemen led by saudi arabia thats what i did so my view is that in a world moving toward authoritarianism the united states has got to be the leader where people all over the world look to us for guidance,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you senator thank you gentlemen i want to change topics and ask each of you about some of your vulnerabilities in this election starting with you vice president biden senator sanders has one more of the hispanic vote than you in several key states so far in fact he doubled your support in california among hispanics he almost tripled it in nevada so why is your message not resonating with hispanic voters,13
Joe Biden, well look my message has resonated across the board every single state weve been in theres been a significant turnout in virginia turnout was up 70 they voted for me he didnt bring them out i brought them out and number two look whats happened in mississippi look whats happened in north carolina look whats happened in washington state look whats happening across the board why is it that im winning all those places whats the reason whats the reason the reason is because they know i am a democrat with a capital d who in fact believes that our base is the base of the democratic party which are hardworking men and women who are in fact are high school educated african americans and minorities including hispanics but all minorities suburban women people who in fact have a sense of our place in the world thats why i am winning not just winning but overwhelmingly winning not even close in these places and,13
Bernie Sanders, well you didnt quite win,13
Ilia Calderón, senator sanders let me just follow up with you about an issue that youre having for the second consecutive presidential election youre struggling to gain wide support from africanamericans why is your message not resonating with africanamerican voters,13
Bernie Sanders, here is what i believe is happening and this is an important point and why i decided to run for president i think its imperative that we defeat trump i think our campaign of a biracial bigenerational multigenerational grassroots movement is the way to do it now we have won some states joe has won more states than i have but heres what we are winning we are winning the ideological struggle even in states like mississippi where joe won a major victory it turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in medicare for  and thats true in almost every state in this country,13
Bernie Sanders, and the other issue that we dont talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle depending on the state were winning people 50 years of age or younger big time people 30 years of age and younger i frankly have my doubts,13
Bernie Sanders, look if i lose this thing joe wins joe i will be there for you but i have my doubts about how you win a general election against trump will be a very very tough opponent unless you have energy excitement the largest voter turnout in history and to do that you are going to have to bring young people who are not great voters they dont vote in the kinds of numbers they should into the political process youre going to have to bring latinos who are great people have the agenda that we need but also dont vote in the numbers that we need i have my doubts that vice president bidens campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout,13
Joe Biden, i will do that and by the way just get this straight the energy and excitement is taking place so far has been for me 70 turnout increased in virginia i can go down the list theyre coming out for me and i didnt even have the money to compete with this man in those states i virtually had no money the press kept saying biden has no money and they were right by net no money and the idea why are they doing that the reason theyre doing that is because they understand i know what has to happen that i know what needs to be done,13
Joe Biden, and by the way the idea that everybody supports medicare for all he has still hadnt indicated how much its going to cost people hes yet to know exactly whats going to  so heres my point people dont know the detail at all and the fact is i am winning,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you sir,13
Joe Biden,  overwhelmingly among democratic constituencies across the board,13
Ilia Calderón, thank you mr vice president we are going to be right back with more from the cnn univision democratic presidential debates stay right there,13
Jake Tapper, welcome back to the cnn univision democratic presidential debate finally gentlemen thanks so much for everything as we end here tonight lets return to where we began the coronavirus which does not discriminate based on ideology it does not care if one is a democrat or republican a conservative a moderate or a progressive senator sanders let me start with you whats your closing message tonight for those who are concerned about effected by or dealing with the coronavirus,13
Bernie Sanders, well our hearts go out to everyone we need to move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus who thinks they have the virus understands they get all the healthcare that they need because they are americans that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there that the ventilators are out there that the icu units are out there that the medical personnel are out there,13
Bernie Sanders, but jake if i might also say that in this moment of economic uncertainty in addition to the coronavirus it is time to ask how we get to where we are not only our lack of preparation for the virus but how we end up with an economy with so many about people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality it is time to ask the question of where the power is in america who owns the media who owns the economy who owns the legislative process why do we give tax breaks to billionaires and not raise the minimum wage,13
Bernie Sanders, why do we pump up the oil industry while a half a million people are homeless in america this is the time to move aggressively dealing with the coronavirus crisis to deal with the economic fallout but its also a time to rethink america and create a country where we care about each other rather than a nation of greed and corruption which is what is taking place among the corporate elite,13
Jake Tapper, thank you senator sanders vice president biden whats your closing message tonight for those concerned about affected by or dealing with with this virus,13
Joe Biden, number one as i said at the outset i just cant imagine what people are going through right now who have lost someone already i cant imagine what people are going through when they have a mom like for example a good friend of ours is sitting outside the window of a nursing home where her mom is because she cant go in trying to do sign language to her mom and through the window to be able to talk to her i guess i can imagine the fear and concern people have number one one of the things that i think we have to understand is that this is an all hands on deck this is as someone said maybe it was you jake at the outset this is bigger than any individual this is bigger than yourself this is about america this is about the world this is about how we bring people together and make the kind of sacrifices we need to make to get this done and so first and foremost where we have to do is start to listen to the science again,13
Joe Biden, as i said what we did we met and that what id be doing today id be sitting down in the situation room literally every day like we did at the outset of other crises we had when we were in the white house and pulling together the best people and not just the united states the world and say what is it what are the prescriptive moves we have to take now to lessen this virus to beat it to go to the point where we can save more lives get more people tested get more people to kind of care they need,13
Joe Biden, and then what do we do beyond that to make sure that the economic impact on them is in fact rendered harmless that we in fact make sure every paycheck is met every paycheck thats out there that the people are going to miss that we keep people in their homes they dont miss their mortgage payments they dont miss their rent payments making sure that theyre going to be able to take care of education and by the way the education systems are closing down right now and so theres so many things we have to do,13
Joe Biden, in addition to that we have to do is we have to have the best science in the world and telling us what can stay open and what need be closed like i said earlier the idea that we are closing schools which i understand but not being able to provide lunches for people who in fact need the school lunch program to get by the idea that we would close any place that i can understand the decision made to close places where a hundred or 50 people or more gather but how do you keep open the drug store to make sure you can get your prescription how do you deal with the things that necessarily have to be kept going and whats the way to do that there should be a national standard for that it should be coming out of the situation room right now,13
Joe Biden, and by the way the single most significant thing we can do should deal with the larger problem down the road of income inequality is get rid of donald trump donald trump hes exacerbated every single one of these problems both the immediate urgent need and how were going to hold people harmless for the damage done as a consequence of this virus its important we do both,13
Jake Tapper, vice president biden senator sanders i would want to thank you both for being here tonight under these challenging and trying circumstances we wish both of you the best our thanks as well to our partners at univision for ilia calderon and dana bash im jake tapper thank you so much for watching please stay healthy stay safe our coverage of both tonights debate and the coronavirus pandemic continues now with anderson cooper,13
